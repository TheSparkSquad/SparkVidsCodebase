this is MC tile over a year ago now I

had one tile to stand on and every 1,000

XP I gain unlocks a new tile I can&#39;t use

Banks or trade other players and I&#39;m

unlocking RuneScape one tile at a time

the goal runescape&#39;s biggest challenge

The

[Music]

Inferno we are in the final stretch

preparing for runescape&#39;s hardest

challenge and with the Rune pouch

upgrade done I have my eyes on what

could just be the final upgrade of the

series I have been putting in the

graveyard shift over at Pest Control I

spent a couple hours last night getting

200 points to spend on Range XP get

myself closer and closer to this final

level for The Inferno

750 KOA from maxing out range it&#39;s been

a long time coming there&#39;s still so much

on the to-do list before The Inferno 99

range 95 magic 94 hit points these are

the three musthave stats I need before I

attempt anything and they&#39;re easily

going to take up the next 50 plus hours

of game time I have some fun plans for

how to use these goals to potentially

get some last second Inferno upgrades

and whenever I have some free time I&#39;ll

be casting some fire strikes like I did

at the start of this week for a couple

hours just an inch away at that 95 magic

goal it is time to get one of if not the

final upgrade of the series so many

things it could be honestly maybe I

don&#39;t even know what it is but first wo

wo you&#39;re looking like you need some

fuel some nice clean energy for your

body maybe that doesn&#39;t make you crash

or Jitter like some of the crappy energy

drinks out on the market you came to the

right place I&#39;m your local gfuel dealer

sponsored by gfuel the sponsor of

today&#39;s video G fuel gfuel is a

performance-based zero sugar energy

drink to fuel your grind but don&#39;t just

take my word for it this is what

happened when I drink g-u last week

gamer Fu

baby g-u comes in so many different

flavors maybe even a billion I don&#39;t

know we have flavors like Bahama Mama

watermelon limeade and one of my

favorites blue ice I&#39;ve definitely drank

that one the most as you can see I&#39;m

somewhat of a collector how can you not

be it it tastes so good and your timing

couldn&#39;t be better with all these

spookified flavors coming out October

9th not to mention all the other stuff G

feel was about to do it&#39;s your lucky day

because I have an astounding 30%

discount for you for a limited time only

you could be sipping on some blue ice

and go straight to clicking on some

pixelated rocks right after use code

settled click the link in the

description or go grab some from Walmart

or Target you will not regret it give it

a shot the plan for today and maybe even

the rest of this week is to fill my

currently empty ring slot it just feels

like a crime to go into The Inferno

without any ring at all and to fill that

ring slot we&#39;re paying a visit to The

Good Old dagoth

[Music]

Kings this is my best option for a good

ring and at 1 and 128 the rates aren&#39;t

bad The Archers ring is good don&#39;t get

me wrong but I have my eyes set on the

Sears ring which might seem a little

weird but I&#39;m happy with my ranged

accuracy at this point something I think

I&#39;ll struggle with on the other hand in

The Inferno is Magic accuracy at the

start of every Inferno wave I&#39;ll be

sending out an ice barrage and hitting

it successfully making makes a wave

significantly easier and currently my

accuracy is roughly 78% which across 60

plus waves isn&#39;t great this Sears ring

can solve that problem when imbued a

Sears ring gives 12 magic accuracy

almost as much as wearing another pair

of Mystic bottoms it&#39;s that good so

we&#39;re off to the dagoth king lir it&#39;s

probably going to take over half my toss

to get down there and honestly my setup

really isn&#39;t great right now I&#39;m just

weighing this probably going to have to

come back with some Blood Spells cuz I

have like no food on me right now I just

kind of wanted to do a run instant like

halfway through the dungeon right now

and I&#39;ve taken so much damage I&#39;m on 48

health I have two food on me oh my God

we made it but at what cost I used all

of my food getting down here I would

have died had I had no food I don&#39;t know

why I underestimated this so

badly oh we are so back Supreme is busy

with someone can I tag Prime from here I

can what the heck that&#39;s actually such a

long range all the kings are weak

to a certain style and luckily Prime is

weak to range so it&#39;s the only one I

plan to kill works out perfectly for me

all right we&#39;re done one prime kill one

Sears ring here we go 865 coins pretty

close not sure how long I&#39;m going to

last here with three food but kills are

insanely Fast Five sharks okay maybe the

best drop I could have gotten apart from

a Sears ring itself now I can stay here

longer the respawn times are so long I

need food to like last until the boss

respawns it should be kill number 10 but

as soon as I see anything I am out of

here cuz this is getting a little yep

that&#39;s a big number we&#39;re out we&#39;re out

we&#39;re okay get out almost got kill

number 10 though and now I know I can

bring way more anti- poisons and more

Blood Spells don&#39;t really need that much

prayer as always got to break the

Looting bag and get everything out of it

I think I&#39;ve said it before but

switching to ancients is the biggest

Mobility Nerf in the game for me I&#39;ve

unlocked almost every location in the

game through a Teleport or a shortcut so

not having those teleports or shortcuts

basically blocks me off from most of the

areas that I&#39;ve been in the game once I

switched to ancients so it&#39;s a really

bad Nerf for me and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t

like being on ancients but for the Sears

ring I will do it ancient Spellbook on

oh what&#39;s that oh it&#39;s me you&#39;re dagoth

Prime Champion okay Blood Spells were

worth it I

admit no

way no way 16 Kills baby let&#39;s go I was

ready to grind this thing out for like

12 hours today that is beautiful I think

this is overall the luckiest RuneScape

account I&#39;ve ever made just such

consistent luck can&#39;t believe how fast

that happened 16 skills bro let&#39;s go

we&#39;re not done yet though we&#39;re going to

have to imbue this ring imbuing a ring

doubles its stats so we kind of have to

do it the plan is to sit at nightmare

Zone rilling Quest bosses for uh 6 hours

to get enough points to en the ring

before heading to nightmare Zone I

decided to do the fishing contest Quest

and a little bit of the recipe for

Disaster quest so I can get myself a

rock cake okay there we go got our Rock

cake took a little bit of time but now

nightmare zone is going to be a lot

easier can use this to get myself to 1

HP and then I&#39;ll sip a bunch of

absorption potions in Nightmare Zone and

then monsters can only hit me for one it

costs 4,000 points to get an absorption

potion in this mini game and 650,000

points to imbue this ring so I&#39;m going

to have to spend a lot of points to make

more points that&#39;s just how it goes I

guess I&#39;m about to get 6h hour logged

which means well I&#39;ve been at this for

about 6 hours and I still need about

250,000 points so uh I guess tack on

another 3 hours to the

estimate it&#39;s been a long day this

actually took a lot longer than I

remember and night Zone but the upgrade

is worth every hour spent Sears ring I I

was expecting to spend a few days

hunting the ring and imbuing it together

but I managed all of this in one day it

is pretty late but it is still the same

day so 200k away from 99 range got so

many things done today that was such a

good grind For Me overall and since

we&#39;re done with this rock cake I can

finish up this recipe for Disaster quest

get some uh get some XP get some chest

access I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really going

to help me in any way but next thing on

the list I&#39;m going to be killing

chickens here until I get 50,000

feathers this is grind I haven&#39;t really

been looking forward to all

that 99 range baby it&#39;s been a long long

time coming first skill Cape first 99 on

the account and of course one of the

three Inferno stats I needed I basically

just spent a bunch of time doing Pest

Control since the combat achievements

have made getting points really fast and

it requires very little attention the

long long awaited skill Cape first one

on the account and it&#39;s green just like

my tiles the perk of this cape is it

acts exactly like an accumulator so it

saves my ammo but I&#39;m going to be honest

it&#39;s not that good until I get another

99 that&#39;ll trim the cape and give it

some pretty good stats so I might have

to wait for that before it&#39;s worth using

but that&#39;s another Inferno requirement

off the list two to go okay Real Talk

two major things left to take care of

and they&#39;re way more important than 99

range as cool as that was this will be a

long week for me 95 magic is not only

the grindi thing remaining but also the

most expensive I do have a ton of money

from Gauntlet but I&#39;ll need plenty of

money for The Inferno itself so I need

to be a little careful with my spending

and I have a plan to potentially get

another really cool upgrade if we get

lucky enough I have 27 prayer pluss left

uh I&#39;m going to make them last as long

as possible but I&#39;m using every last one

on Magic XP I&#39;m just going to burst dust

devils until I&#39;m flat broke b almost 600

Browns knives should be enough for dust

devils amazing news guys 91 magic four

levels to

[Music]

go no a I wasn&#39;t paying any attention no

a getting back there is super annoying

especially on the ancient spell book

there goes 40 minutes of my time today

my 27 prayer potions got used up real

fast and before I knew it I had to

resort to other methods of hitting this

95 magic goal I did a lot of different

things from teleporting to fire blasting

to aling and even killing hell hounds

for hard clue Scrolls because I did want

to try my hand at getting another

Inferno upgrade and will definitely

revisit this soon there&#39;s 92 magic

beautiful three to go by the time I hit

93 magic with over 25 plus hours

invested in this grind in particular I

was down hard from the 26 mil I started

the week with everyone doubted me and

here I am with 93 magic I&#39;m not going to

provide any sources as to who doubted me

but uh we do still have two levels to go

and the funds are kind of running a bit

low 17 mil is still a lot of cash but at

this point uh it is what it is 94 magic

long time coming and in theory this

could be good enough for The Inferno but

one little monster specifically this

silly little bat has a chance to drain

my stats and if I&#39;m drained below 94

magic I can&#39;t can&#39;t freeze things and

that&#39;s a risk that could jeopardize a

run and I can&#39;t be having that so we&#39;re

reaching for one more magic level and I

know exactly how I want to do it because

I finally have a ton of tiles prepared

for a big clue scroll session this is

what I was waiting for 3500 tiles to

work with hard clue completion rate is

not good but with this many tiles I can

probably bump it up by a couple percent

and hopefully get some completions

hopefully get a last minute Inferno gear

upgrade at this point there&#39;s not a ton

of slots that I could realistically

upgrade except for three of them them

boots gloves and ammo all three of these

could be upgraded from a hard clue

scroll and each of them has six

potential upgrade options all of these

potential upgrades increase my prayer

bonus which in my opinion is the

greatest currency in The Inferno I only

have 10 prayer bonus with my current

setup which could definitely be improved

and that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re going to

try to do on this hard clue scroll hunt

and in the meantime we have 700k magic

XP left to finish off 95 magic so why

not I&#39;m well aware there are many better

things I could be doing for clue Scrolls

right now but I just want to do this so

let&#39;s go it&#39;s been a while hard clue

what&#39;s the first step shallow Village

ckr very doable let&#39;s do it okay so the

second step is Wilderness it&#39;s not that

far from the canoe I unlocked and since

my whole thing right now is completing

hard Clues I am down to risk this one by

risk it I mean I&#39;m just going to die in

Edgeville and all my stuff is going to

stay here I&#39;ve avoided doing this in the

past because I don&#39;t want to do it for

every single Wilderness step but since

our entire goal right now is to complete

hard Clues I can&#39;t really avoid them

it&#39;s like a one in five shot that you

get a Wilderness step on a hard clue so

I I just I kind of have to to suck it up

and start unlocking them start doing

them Maple Sho coming in clutch the

weapon of Champions uh let&#39;s see if this

oh a looting bag that&#39;s actually pretty

nice so I want to have to get another

one later another step and another

Wilderness clue this is what I&#39;m talking

about they&#39;re just so common that I&#39;m

kind of forced to do them so I&#39;ll be

storing my stuff at Edgeville and just

going into these Wilderness Clues I mean

it&#39;s like 30 minutes every time I have

to do that but makes me wonder what it&#39;s

like to play with a bank these days I

forget sometimes that 99.99% of players

can just Bank their things and then go

into the Wilderness and do a clue it&#39;s

just not a big deal I forget about that

stuff never in a million years did I

think I&#39;d be completing this agility

course on this account another Brave

wizard taken from this world step number

four another doable one this could be

the final one too uh I can go pick up my

stuff cuz this is not a dangerous one

that should be good for now I grabbed

most of my stuff I&#39;ll come back for the

rest of it after we finish this step and

another step step number

five okay so for this one we need two

different quests we need Merlin&#39;s

Crystal and and holy grail uh I&#39;m going

to go take care of those then that&#39;s

going to take like an hour to do these

two quests but afterward we should most

likely get a casket so very challenging

Quest Merlin&#39;s Crystal done now we just

need to do Holy Grail and we&#39;re good to

go we&#39;re not even done with the quest

here yet and we get another step okay

thank God I can do it I was about to be

really really upset if I couldn&#39;t do

this step getting blocked on step six

would have been so miserable but uh we

are guaranteed a casket here and not

only that but holy grail completed got a

lot of XP from that Quest genuinely very

good reward for that yes there it is

baby six step hard clue we went through

a lot to do that and I am so excited to

see the reward it&#39;s been a while since

I&#39;ve done a hard clue so many upgrades

we could get from

this it&#39;s um I mean I&#39;ll it&#39;s some money

I can&#39;t really save this one it&#39;s just a

bad clue I got to do the bar crawl for

this step which means I got to go visit

like 11 bars in RuneScape that&#39;s going

to be pretty expensive tile wise but

that&#39;s what they&#39;re for right and I have

to drop this I can&#39;t uh I can&#39;t do this

clue no matter what unfortunately can&#39;t

do anything to grind it out it&#39;s just a

it&#39;s just a lock it&#39;s time to level up

in the world of hard Clues I&#39;m getting

back on the ancient spell book we&#39;re

about to burst some jellies because they

have an insane hard clue rate and if I

can kill like what Seven 8 nine at a

time we&#39;re going to be getting them so

much faster I don&#39;t have any prayer

potions but I&#39;m just going to be prayer

flicking the entire time at least as

much as I can and this should be way

faster for getting clues boom Oh my God

that was so fast 5 minutes 5 minutes for

a hard clue

and step number five yes another hard

clue completed let&#39;s go I&#39;m so excited

it&#39;s just I don&#39;t get to complete them

very often and we get uh black di body

Rune skirt I mean just a bunch of

alchables again I mean it is what it is

that&#39;s kind of how hard Clues go hoping

for a better tomorrow with uh with

actual uniques 18 that I can get that

can help me I I have faith I have faith

that I&#39;m going to get one of them this

will be the longest hard clue step I&#39;ve

ever unlocked uh clocking in at just

over 500 tiles just to get to one little

place okay and we have another completed

hard clue beautiful let&#39;s see what we

get from

this oh it looked so promising look at

how many unique four uniques in that

clue I know it&#39;s a long shot for an

upgrade but I that that does look good

for uniques in a clue can&#39;t complain

about that that&#39;s pretty sick things you

love to see another hard clue on the

ground no things you hate to see an

impossible step oh oh I&#39;ve been waiting

for this it&#39;s been 3 weeks since I got

my first stamina potion that&#39;s my second

stamina potion for The Inferno now

beautiful doing a little detour I

decided to get the items for this medium

clue step and I&#39;m going to build the

stash unit here so that I can complete

it in the future medium Clues also have

about eight potential upgrades for The

Inferno so they are still worth doing

but I&#39;m going to stick to hards for the

most part I think tomorrow I&#39;m going to

stack a couple easy medium and hard

caskets just so we can have a big

opening with all of them I think that

would be really fun and we get the

medium casket nice this clue actually

took over an hour because I had to get a

a lot of different items for it let&#39;s

see what we get uh armad page 4 we did

get a unique just not what we were

looking for fair game so I&#39;ve once again

run into a bit of a roadblock I need to

finish fairy tale part two for this next

step and that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m going

to go do might as well just unlock it

permanently so I&#39;ll see you in an hour

luckily I did have most of this Quest

area already unlocked so we do get some

herblore XP and a little lamp that I&#39;m

just going to also use on herblore I

think no I can&#39;t do the next

step I started the next morning by

getting a couple medium Clues an easy

clue and a hard clue and trying to

complete all of them for one big opening

session I was able to complete two

medium Clues this morning and this

should be the final step of this easy

clue the only thing we can get from

easys are blessings that&#39;s our easy clue

completed and we have one step remaining

on this hard clue so we&#39;re going to have

four caskets to open I&#39;m pretty excited

turned out to be a really good idea to

get that fairy tale part two done

because it&#39;s my last step on this hard

clue with medium Clues on the table now

we can hope for either Ranger boots or

holy sandals as a big buff to The

Inferno setup rolling a useful boot pair

is extremely unlikely though to say the

least got the hard casket which means we

have four caskets to open honestly not

bad odds not not terrible odds of

getting something here start with the

easy clue not very high hopes for this

one but honestly that&#39;s a lot of money

for an easy clue that&#39;s probably three

times the average you can expect from an

easy moving on to the

mediums no

way no way I&#39;m in disbel five five Clues

five mediums for that that&#39;s like the

best pair of boots I could have gotten

for The

Inferno what is that luck on clue number

five what is going on and I still have

two more caskets to open okay uh let&#39;s

let&#39;s open another one uh we get a

sariden page some runes not really that

interesting it&#39;s really hard to top that

to be fair really really hard to top

that clue and we have our hard casket to

finish it up the the pirate hat okay

what a clue session I actually want to

keep this hat so bad I think I will it&#39;s

it&#39;s just lovely I mean look at me I was

going to grind way more clues but this

is as good as it gets um I can&#39;t beat

holy sandals these are such a good pull

unlike Ranger boots or God deide boots

they don&#39;t give any negative magic

attack bonus so in my opinion these are

the best boots I could have gotten well

I guess we can go ahead and Al all the

stuff we don&#39;t need wa how did that

happen all right enough of that 95 magic

Inferno stat number two completed one

final level on the agenda before we are

good to go and that&#39;s 94 hit points and

you know what I think I know just the

way to grind this level

[Music]

out it&#39;s been 9 months since I first

killed Z on this account and it was

pretty difficult back then with the gear

we were working with nowadays things are

a little different I am really geared

out to grind this boss Zora holds one

amazing Inferno upgrade and that&#39;s the

blowpipe I talked about it 9 months ago

and it remains as relevant today as it

did before it&#39;s not a necessity but it

has so many cases in The Inferno that

are so useful the special attack can

heal you it&#39;s double the speed of the

BofA so it&#39;s great for low HP and low

defense targets ultimately it would just

be really good to have even though it&#39;s

been 9 months since I&#39;ve done Zora on

this account the main inconveniences of

the boss have stayed the same throughout

all this time I&#39;m still going to have to

make my own rings of recoil I&#39;m still

going to have to go buy anti- poisons

every trip so that stuff definitely

still limits my kills per hour like a

huge amount this time around the luxury

I have is my gear is good enough that I

think I can get kills with much less

food so I&#39;m going to be making five or

six rings of recoil and I&#39;ll just keep

them in my inventory so that I don&#39;t

have to make them as often as I did last

time I&#39;m hoping this gear is good enough

to just consistently get kills with a

lower amount of food I don&#39;t even have

any switches or anything I&#39;m just going

in with this range setup and I&#39;ll be

ranging every single phase even the ones

that aren&#39;t weak to range as anticipated

the bow is just ripping nonstop it

really doesn&#39;t matter that I have no

switches it doesn&#39;t matter that I&#39;m

attacking with the same style on every

phase zor is so much fun in this gear I

can definitely see myself staying here a

while because it&#39;s just so free like

it&#39;s just so insanely free with this

setup our first kill back and we get uh

honestly a pretty good drop I will take

that I like the battle staffs 3 minute

kill actually a bit long I think we

we&#39;ll probably be averaging like 2 and

1/2 minute kill or so boom just like

that absolutely shattered the PB 2

minutes 11 and an insane drop 70 Manas

is so good for

[Music]

me what is that drop I just got a loop

and tooth half in one drop and from the

first Crystal key on the account we get

uh nothing great uh pretty

[Music]

standard oh my God no way 44 kills

that&#39;s insane actually the second best

drop I could have gotten obviously the

blowpipe would have been amazing to get

this so early is so important I never

need anti-poison to kill zra ever again

I have permanent immunity to poison and

Venom this is a godsend drop for this

grind so good genuinely such an amazing

drop to get I&#39;m losing a little bit of

DPS since I&#39;m not wearing the crystal

Helm but to not be worried about getting

poisoned I think is so much bigger than

that see I can put the crystal Helm on

during phases where I absolutely can&#39;t

be poisoned I&#39;m getting like 8 to n

kills per hour right now but with no

more stops for anti-p poisons we could

be getting an extra kill per hour now

that&#39;s a PB 145 what a nice PB ooh you

know I&#39;ve been thinking about this I&#39;ve

been uh I was expecting to get one of

these eventually I can do this step

actually I&#39;m going to go try to do this

but I&#39;ve never completed an elite clue

on this account the odds are insanely

low I just with these restrictions and

my stats it&#39;s just not a high

probability but it would be really

really cool just to say I&#39;ve done one on

this account so I will be attempting

every single Elite clue I get from zoraa

and maybe just maybe we can complete one

string of youu Longbow that is maybe one

of the worst ones I could have gotten if

I still had the money I actually would

spend it on Fletching but I&#39;m down to 6

and 1 12 mil so we&#39;ll get more we&#39;ll get

[Music]

more

oh I can get the combat task here please

yes oh my

god I&#39;ve been trying to get that combat

task for so long and we get another

Elite clue let&#39;s go see if we can do

this one got another super deep

Wilderness step these Elite Clues could

rob me of every tile I have there&#39;s so

many steps that I don&#39;t have unlocked

that would take 6 or 7,000 more tiles

okay please just be a casket this is

Step six no please oh it&#39;s a Sherlock

step this could be so bad I want to say

there&#39;s only about 30% of Sherlock steps

that I can complete right now which is

not the the odds do not favor me here

this is Step number seven please be

humble no no not that I have literally

one Rune crafting that is it&#39;s step

seven bro it&#39;s step

seven the worst skill for me it&#39;s

literally I have zero XP dude how long

is 44 Rune crafting I&#39;d have to go to

library that&#39;s like I don&#39;t know 10 11

hours do I want to invest that amount of

time into all right there&#39;s 44 Rune

crafting what I was always going to get

it this actually ended up being more

like 15 hours by the way I didn&#39;t think

it would take this long but there are

just some things in this world that you

have to do 15 hours of run crafting

later nature Rune made although that&#39;s

the first Rune I&#39;ve actually Rune

crafted I&#39;ve did everything through

Library so by the way this was my first

time training Rune crafting in over 5

years this is why you do it for this

view this is why you do it right here

potentially the only Elite clue I&#39;ll

complete on this account Let&#39;s uh see

what we get

um it&#39;s it&#39;s about what I expected

honestly it would have been cool to see

a cool unique but you know what honestly

no regrets that&#39;s a bucket list item we

take it I&#39;ve been at zorao for 2 days

now with one unique at 44 kill count

we&#39;re getting close to hitting the rate

for another and I&#39;ve decided to set a

hard C at 250 zra kills if I don&#39;t get

the blowpipe by then I&#39;ll be stepping

into The Inferno without it and just

trying my luck every time I die at Z

it&#39;s about a 30 minute time waste I have

to uh buy runes over here just so I can

get back to the Charter I have to do two

trips to get my stuff back so it&#39;s just

very costly time wise to die you really

don&#39;t want to die number 140 for a

dragon hird we need the money honestly I

don&#39;t know what happened man my money

just evaporated 150 KC and we get zoraa

master that&#39;s all right that&#39;s actually

a big combat achievement for me Five

Points I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m super close

to the medium combat achievements now

very close to the mediums actually 18

points away just for a little bit of a

break I&#39;m going to go kill giant mole

for some combat tasks because I&#39;m so

close to the mediums and I can easily

get a couple points here decided to kill

the easiest boss in the game for five

more points I just kind of want to

finish off the mediums before The

Inferno I it&#39;s just so close at this

point that I kind of want to do it 156

we need the death runes good good drop

we&#39;re up to 7K death runes in the Rune

pouch I&#39;m collecting those as much as I

can entering day four of zra I was

officially going dry for a second unique

and approaching my hard cap of 250 kills

on the bright side I&#39;m up almost 3,000

death runes since starting this grind

and I&#39;m getting very close to 94 hit

points which was one of the main points

of this wow what a drop eight teleports

that&#39;s so good for me that speeds up my

kill so much I said I would go to 250

but if I don&#39;t get a unique by 250 then

I think I&#39;m just going to go until I get

another unique drop because I think it

would be sad to end with only one battle

stabs and teleports though nice pretty

good

drop oh my God that&#39;s a unique but not

what I was looking for

no no I can&#39;t even make any jewelry out

of it dude my crafting level&#39;s too low

that&#39;s such a sad one to get that&#39;s the

saddest unique you can get I was uh I

was 200 kills on the Dot from our Ser

Helm 200 kills for the Onyx I guess I

will be stopping at 250 then I did get

the second unique after all so I&#39;m going

to get these last six kills done maybe

we get a miracle drop here okay it all

ends here took the full 4 days to get

250 kills I want to say over 30 hours to

get this kill count the Ser is nice I&#39;m

still happy I&#39;m going to keep the Ser

Helm but uh this is what the Looting bag

is looking like right now I got a bunch

of Snap Dragons from zra which at least

that&#39;s a really nice thing that&#39;s going

to be more Super restores for The

Inferno which is great and I also got a

bunch of death runes I think I ended up

getting around 7K death runes from this

grind so tons of great things a lot of

great benefits it&#39;s not necessar only

the blowpipe that helps me out here

definitely a lot of conveniences that I

could get that would make Zora twice as

fast three times as fast but we worked

with what we could after finishing up

our 4day Zora grind I decided it was

time to tie up some loose ends and

that&#39;s what I spent an entire day doing

I made back a decent portion of my money

by selling my Zora drops I took the 200

noted dragon bones I got from Zora and

decided to use them on the Wilderness

alter and got over 990,000 prayer XP

leaving me really close to 70 prayer I

got my first hisor Kill from combat

achievements and ended up finishing the

medium tier and we get 71 her blur from

the lamp let&#39;s go with the medium combat

achievements completed I was now getting

an extra two points per Pest Control

game allowing me to very easily finish

off 94 hit points and racking up just

enough points for one final level I

can&#39;t believe I&#39;m about to enter The

Inferno 70 prayer that is the last level

I&#39;m getting all my loose ends tied up

all my levels gotten I am entirely ready

uh that was it so it all comes down to

this with just under 2,000 hours of play

time on the account unlocking RuneScape

one tile at a time it&#39;s finally time to

beat runescape&#39;s biggest challenge I&#39;ve

been waiting to say those words and I&#39;ll

see you in the

[Music]

finale
