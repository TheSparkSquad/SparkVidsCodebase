1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
you need a system that's it I would want

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,080
to code every day I even had the time to

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:07,359
but I would get so anxious from looking

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,280
at all the projects or challenges I

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
could do that I would just give up and

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,519
start wasting time that was until I

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
built the system and I call it the

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,880
coding menu it's a list of all the

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:17,859
coding I can do by time and energy

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,900
levels so for example if I only had an

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:22,779
appetite to code 30 minutes for the day

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,880
I can just write a small project like a

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,279
weight converter or try a super easy

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,019
coding challenge like twosome and even

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,420
if my project doesn't work or my

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,279
Challenge Fails I can always do it again

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,020
tomorrow but what if I don't want to do

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
that or if I get bored in that case I

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,980
had a list blocked by time and options

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
like a menu once I had this list even if

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,780
I was tired and I could only code for

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,820
just 30 minutes having an exact plan for

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,340
my time got me coding almost naturally

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
to the point where days I couldn't

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
program felt weird and having a menu or

26
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,940
a plan on what I should do took all the

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
thinking away so I could just get to

28
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,719
work whenever I wanted and seeing my

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
GitHub get greener is almost magical but

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,460
wait a minute why should I even do this

31
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,199
coding is a skill and you can only

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,180
improve if you practice your craft every

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
day you can't expect to improve from day

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
one but once you've programmed for

35
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,299
enough time you'll look back on your

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
code and find out where you want to

37
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,420
improve progress only happens in small

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
incremental chunks you can't become a

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
master overnight you just have to put

40
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,180
your head down and keep trying and one

41
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,159
day you'll see how far you've come thank

42
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,020
you for your time I am big box
