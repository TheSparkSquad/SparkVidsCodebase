this is MC tile over a year ago now I

had one tile to stand on and every 1,000

XP I gain unlocks a new tile I can&#39;t use

Banks or trade other players and I&#39;m

unlocking RuneScape one tile at a time

the goal runescape&#39;s biggest challenge

The

[Music]

Inferno we are in the final stretch

preparing for runescape&#39;s hardest

challenge and with the Rune pouch

upgrade done I have my eyes on what

could just be the final upgrade of the

series I have been putting in the

graveyard shift over at Pest Control I

spent a couple hours last night getting

200 points to spend on Range XP get

myself closer and closer to this final

level for The Inferno

750 KOA from maxing out range it&#39;s been

a long time coming there&#39;s still so much

on the to-do list before The Inferno 99

range 95 magic 94 hit points these are

the three musthave stats I need before I

attempt anything and they&#39;re easily

going to take up the next 50 plus hours

of game time I have some fun plans for

how to use these goals to potentially

get some last second Inferno upgrades

and whenever I have some free time I&#39;ll

be casting some fire strikes like I did

at the start of this week for a couple

hours just an inch away at that 95 magic

goal it is time to get one of if not the

final upgrade of the series so many

things it could be honestly maybe I

don&#39;t even know what it is but first wo

wo you&#39;re looking like you need some

fuel some nice clean energy for your

body maybe that doesn&#39;t make you crash

or Jitter like some of the crappy energy

drinks out on the market you came to the

right place I&#39;m your local gfuel dealer

sponsored by gfuel the sponsor of

today&#39;s video G fuel gfuel is a

performance-based zero sugar energy

drink to fuel your grind but don&#39;t just

take my word for it this is what

happened when I drink g-u last week

gamer Fu

baby g-u comes in so many different

flavors maybe even a billion I don&#39;t

know we have flavors like Bahama Mama

watermelon limeade and one of my

favorites blue ice I&#39;ve definitely drank

that one the most as you can see I&#39;m

somewhat of a collector how can you not

be it it tastes so good and your timing

couldn&#39;t be better with all these

spookified flavors coming out October

9th not to mention all the other stuff G

feel was about to do it&#39;s your lucky day

because I have an astounding 30%

discount for you for a limited time only

you could be sipping on some blue ice

and go straight to clicking on some

pixelated rocks right after use code

settled click the link in the

description or go grab some from Walmart

or Target you will not regret it give it

a shot the plan for today and maybe even

the rest of this week is to fill my

currently empty ring slot it just feels

like a crime to go into The Inferno

without any ring at all and to fill that

ring slot we&#39;re paying a visit to The

Good Old dagoth

[Music]

Kings this is my best option for a good

ring and at 1 and 128 the rates aren&#39;t

bad The Archers ring is good don&#39;t get

me wrong but I have my eyes set on the

Sears ring which might seem a little

weird but I&#39;m happy with my ranged

accuracy at this point something I think

I&#39;ll struggle with on the other hand in

The Inferno is Magic accuracy at the

start of every Inferno wave I&#39;ll be

sending out an ice barrage and hitting

it successfully making makes a wave

significantly easier and currently my

accuracy is roughly 78% which across 60

plus waves isn&#39;t great this Sears ring

can solve that problem when imbued a

Sears ring gives 12 magic accuracy

almost as much as wearing another pair

of Mystic bottoms it&#39;s that good so

we&#39;re off to the dagoth king lir it&#39;s

probably going to take over half my toss

to get down there and honestly my setup

really isn&#39;t great right now I&#39;m just

weighing this probably going to have to

come back with some Blood Spells cuz I

have like no food on me right now I just

kind of wanted to do a run instant like

halfway through the dungeon right now

and I&#39;ve taken so much damage I&#39;m on 48

health I have two food on me oh my God

we made it but at what cost I used all

of my food getting down here I would

have died had I had no food I don&#39;t know

why I underestimated this so

badly oh we are so back Supreme is busy

with someone can I tag Prime from here I

can what the heck that&#39;s actually such a

long range all the kings are weak

to a certain style and luckily Prime is

weak to range so it&#39;s the only one I

plan to kill works out perfectly for me

all right we&#39;re done one prime kill one

Sears ring here we go 865 coins pretty

close not sure how long I&#39;m going to

last here with three food but kills are

insanely Fast Five sharks okay maybe the

best drop I could have gotten apart from

a Sears ring itself now I can stay here

longer the respawn times are so long I

need food to like last until the boss

respawns it should be kill number 10 but

as soon as I see anything I am out of

here cuz this is getting a little yep

that&#39;s a big number we&#39;re out we&#39;re out

we&#39;re okay get out almost got kill

number 10 though and now I know I can

bring way more anti- poisons and more

Blood Spells don&#39;t really need that much

prayer as always got to break the

Looting bag and get everything out of it

I think I&#39;ve said it before but

switching to ancients is the biggest

Mobility Nerf in the game for me I&#39;ve

unlocked almost every location in the

game through a Teleport or a shortcut so

not having those teleports or shortcuts

basically blocks me off from most of the

areas that I&#39;ve been in the game once I

switched to ancients so it&#39;s a really

bad Nerf for me and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t

like being on ancients but for the Sears

ring I will do it ancient Spellbook on

oh what&#39;s that oh it&#39;s me you&#39;re dagoth
