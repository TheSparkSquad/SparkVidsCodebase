in this segment we start a discussion of

multiple continuous random variables

here are some objects that were already

familiar with but exactly as in the

discrete case if we are dealing with two

random variables it is not enough to

know their individual PDFs we also need

to model the relation between the two

random variables and this is done

through a joint PDF which is the

continuous analogue of the joint PMF we

will use this notation to indicate joint

PDFs where we use F to indicate that we

are dealing with a density so what

remains to be done is to actually define

this object and see how we use it let us

start by recalling that joint pmfs were

defined in terms of the probability that

the pair of random variables x and y

takes certain specific values little X

and little Y regarding joint PDFs we

start by saying that it has to be

non-negative however a more precise

interpretation in terms of probabilities

has to wait a little bit

joint PDFs will be used to calculate

probabilities and this will be done in

analogy with the discrete setting in the

discrete setting the probability that

the pair of random variables falls

inside a certain set is just the sum of

the probabilities of all the possible

pairs inside that particular set for the

continuous case we introduce an

analogous formula we use the joint

density instead of the joint PMF and

instead of having a summation we now

integrate as in the discrete setting we

have one total unit of probability the

joint PDF tells us how this unit of

probability is spread over the entire

continuous two-dimensional plane and we

use it we use the joint PDF to calculate

the

ability of a certain set by finding the

volume under the joint PDF that lies on

top of that set this is what this

integral really represents we integrate

over a particular 2-dimensional set and

we take this value that we integrate and

we can think of this as the height of an

object that&#39;s sitting on top of that set

now this relation here this calculation

of probabilities is not something that

we are supposed to prove this is rather

the definition of what a joint PDF does

a legitimate joint PDF is any function

of two variables which is non-negative

and which integrates to 1 and we will

say that two random variables are

jointly continuous if there is a

legitimate joint PDF that can be used to

calculate the Associated probabilities

through this particular formula so we

have really an indirect definition

instead of defining the joint PDF as a

probability we actually define it

indirectly by saying what it does how it

will be used to calculate probabilities

a picture will be helpful here here is a

plot of a possible joint PDF these are

the X and y axes and the faction being

plotted is the joint PDF of these two

random variables this joint PDF is

higher at some places and lower at

others indicating that certain regions

of the XY plane are more likely than

others the joint PDF determines the

probability of a set B by integrating

over that set B let&#39;s say it&#39;s this set

integrating the PDF over that set

pictorially what this means

is that we look at the volume that sits

on top of that set but below the PDF

below the joint PDF and so we obtain

some three-dimensional objects of this

kind and this integral corresponds to

actually finding this volume here the

volume that sits on top of the set B but

which is below the joint PDF

let us now develop some additional

understanding of joint PDFs as we just

discussed for any given set B we can

integrate the joint PDF over that set

and this will give us the probability of

that particular set of particular

interest is the case where we are

dealing with a set which is a rectangle

in which case the situation is a little

simpler so suppose that we have a

rectangle where the x-coordinate ranges

from a to b and the y-coordinate ranges

from some c to some d then the double

integral over this particular rectangle

can be written in the form where we

first integrate with respect one of the

variables that ranges from A to B and

then we integrate over all possible

values of y as they range from C to D a

particular interest is the special case

where we&#39;re dealing with a small

rectangle such as this one a rectangle

with sizes equal to some Delta where

Delta is a small number in that case the

double integral which is the volume on

top of that rectangle is simpler to

evaluate it is equal to the value of the

function that we are integrating at some

point in the rectangle let&#39;s take that

corner times the area of the

little rectangle which is equal to Delta

square so we have an interpretation of

the joint PDF in terms of probabilities

of small rectangles joint PDFs are not

probabilities but rather they are

probability densities they tell us the

probability per unit area and one more

important comment for the case of a

single continuous random variable we

know that any single point has zero

probability this is a game true for the

case of two jointly continuous random

variables but more is true if you take a

set B that has zero area for example a

certain curve suppose that this curve is

the entire set B then the volume under

the joint PDF that&#39;s sitting on top of

that curve is going to be equal to zero

so zero area sets have zero probability

and this is one of the characteristic

features of jointly continuous random

variables now let&#39;s think of a

particular situation suppose that X is a

continuous random variable and let Y be

another random variable which is

identically equal to X since X is a

continuous random variable Y is also a

continuous random variable however in

this situation we are certain that the

outcome of the experiment is going to

fall on the line where x equals y all

the probability lies on top of a line

and a line has zero area so we have

positive probability on a set of zero

area which contradicts what we discussed

before

well this simply means that x and y are

not jointly continuous each one of them

is continuous but together they&#39;re not

jointly continuous essentially joint

continuity is something more than

requiring each random very

to be continued by itself for joint

continuity we want the probability to be

really spread over two dimensions

probability is not allowed to be

concentrated on a one-dimensional set on

the other hand in this example the

probability is concentrated on a

one-dimensional set and we do not have

joint continuity
