This is MC tile.
Over a year ago, I had just one tile to stand on.
For every 1,000 XP I gain, I unlock a new tile.
I can't use banks or trade with other players.
I'm unlocking RuneScape one tile at a time.
My ultimate goal? RuneScape's biggest challenge: The Inferno.

Now, we are in the final stretch, preparing for RuneScape's toughest challenge.
With the Rune pouch upgrade completed, I'm eyeing what might be the series' final upgrade.
I've been dedicating time at Pest Control, spending hours last night to earn 200 points for Range XP.
I'm inching closer to the final level for The Inferno.
Only 750 KOA left to max out range.
It's been a journey.
Still, I have a hefty to-do list before The Inferno:
99 range, 95 magic, and 94 hit points.
These stats are essential.
Achieving them will easily take up the next 50+ hours of game time.
I've some fun plans to grab some last-minute Inferno upgrades.
Whenever I've spare time, I'll be casting fire strikes, chipping away at the 95 magic goal.

It's time for perhaps the final upgrade of the series.
There are so many possibilities.
Maybe I don't even know what it is.
But first, you look like you need some energy.
A clean, no-crash energy unlike most energy drinks on the market.
I'm here to introduce you to Gfuel, today's video sponsor.
Gfuel is a zero-sugar, performance-based energy drink.
But don't just trust my word.
Here's my experience drinking Gfuel last week:
Gamer Fuel, available in numerous flavors like Bahama Mama, Watermelon Limeade, and my favorite, Blue Ice.
And, if you're a fan, there are special flavors releasing on October 9th.
Today, you're in luck!
I have a 30% discount just for you.
Grab some Gfuel using code 'settled' or pick it up from Walmart or Target.

For today and maybe the week, I'm filling my empty ring slot.
It feels wrong to face The Inferno without a ring.
To address this, I'm visiting the Dagoth Kings.
I'm aiming for the Sears ring, which offers a significant magic accuracy boost.
The beginning of every Inferno wave involves me casting an ice barrage.
A successful hit eases the wave significantly.
But my current accuracy stands at 78% across 60 waves.
The Sears ring, when imbued, provides 12 magic accuracy.
That's almost like wearing another Mystic bottom.
Now, off to Dagoth King Lir.
My journey there is perilous, and I'm not well-prepared.
After some near-death experiences, I face Prime.
After 16 attempts, success! I've secured the Sears ring.
But the journey doesn't end here.
I need to imbue it at the nightmare zone for enhanced stats.
