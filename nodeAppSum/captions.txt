uh anti-Semitism as we know is a hatred

uh and Prejudice and racism towards

Jewish people and their faith and their

ethnicity uh anti-zionism is um a

movement fighting against the occupation

this is a settler Colonial fascist

regime that we&#39;re seeing attempting to

wipe out an entire indigenous uh

civilian population and your perspective

what is Zionism 75 years of brutal

occupation ethnic cleansing apartheid

and colonization of the Palestinian

people and and the occupation and the

OCC

Israel is a Zionist State and I think

that&#39;s what we really have to focus on

today yeah hello my name is sta um I&#39;m

proud of the Palestinian youth movement

and we&#39;re here with the Palestinian and

Arab youth in the diaspora as well as

our solidarity allies demanding the uh

The Siege and end on Gaza and for the

blockade to be lifted where they have

been under blockade for 16 years um

where they&#39;ve been denied the basic

human rights of just living a life along

with having food water fuel electricity

and we&#39;re here also to talk about the 75

years of military occupation that

Palestine has been under since 1948

people need to see the Palestinians for

who they are part of a revolutionary

struggle for Liberation we understand

Zionism to be a form of white supremacy

and the people have a right to resist

their occupiers by any means necessary

what do you think about Hamas uh I will

not um that you&#39;re not asking the right

questions it&#39;s the wrong question I

think that to we can&#39;t um we can&#39;t

equate the colonizer with the colonized

we can&#39;t equate the occupier with the

occupied it implies that these are equal

parties and it&#39;s not equal

so you feel like violence is a reaction

to oppression yes but they also have the

moral right to defend themselves against

their colonizers and their occupiers and

this is something that we really need to

focus on as media and instead of

painting Palestinians and dehumanizing

them and demonizing them and putting all

these anti-arab and anti-muslim tropes

against them which the West has been

imposing to justify the ethnic cleansing

that Israel has already done and will

continue to do so this is something that

we need to focus on and see the

Palestinians are there defending

themselves as part of revolutionary

struggle for Liberation we need our

countries back that&#39;s

it free free Palestine uh from the land

what is it from the land to the Sea

Palestine will be free from the river to

the sea from The River To The Sea that&#39;s

right yeah from The River To The Sea

Palestine will be free Rockets were

fired into Israel as gunmen infiltrated

several border towns and bases they

swarmed into Israel by land sea and even

on paragliders and then they went on a

rampage slaughtering civilians in the

street it was a it&#39;s a horrible

situation yeah and it was the worst day

in Jewish history in terms of deaths

since the Holocaust 1300 people died and

what can you tell us about what&#39;s going

on well uh the rage goes all the way

back I mean basically what we have is we

have two nationalist movements that are

buying for control over a piece of

territory Hamas is in charge of the Gaza

Strip which is in the south of Israel on

the coast uh it was founded in 1987

during the first Uprising against

Israeli

occupation Hamas won elections actually

in 2006 and then took over the Gaza

Strip in 2017 hamas&#39;s Charter said that

uh all of Palestine should be an Islamic

State on a core level it uh believes

that Palestine is a gift of God it&#39;s a

religious endowment and that they really

can&#39;t surrender any part of that

religious Endowment for Jews it was a

place that um has been remembered in you

know Jewish prayer and Jewish history

the Jews actually had a kingdom there uh

under David and Solomon and uh were

there until the Romans threw them out

and so the idea was the restoration of

the community back to its ancestral land

and so therefore what we see is two

groups that are vying for control over a

single small area actually about the

size of New Jersey the thing about Gaza

which you know your audience should know

is that Gaza is a extraordinarily

crowded one of the most crowded places

on Earth extraordinarily poor society in

which you know about half the population

is under the age of 18 so any Israeli

incursion into Gaza is going to be

killing a lot of children if you&#39;re

living in Gaza are you allowed to travel

freely throughout Israel no can you just

go for like the weekend no no you can&#39;t

go to the West Bank either you&#39;re you&#39;re

pretty much isolated in Gaza wait so can

you is there an airport no okay so in

order to be able to cross from one to

another you have to go through

checkpoints and uh it&#39;s not a free

movement to Travelers one of my students

for example was a Palestinian from Gaza

and uh Palestinians have to be back in

the territories at nightfall uh they

can&#39;t stay in Israel proper so uh he had

to actually camp out in the West Bank to

go to university in the West Bank in

spite of the fact that his home was in

Gaza because he couldn&#39;t pass through

Israel in order to uh go from one to the

other and that curfew is imposed by

Israel by Israel why well that&#39;s a

question for the Israelis actually uh

the Israelis think that you know uh the

uh Palestinians are are

dangerous um there was a second Uprising

that took place in 2000 against Israeli

occupation uh and it was extraordinarily

bloody

do you have family in Palestine yes I do

how are they doing uh we lost 14

relatives in the bombardment and uh

currently I haven&#39;t heard from relatives

in about 12 hours so sorry to hear that

thank you I appreciate it what&#39;s their

life like out there uh there is no

life deadly retribution is raining down

on Gaza Israel says it&#39;s targeting Mass

with waves of air

strikes

uh there is no life this is why uh the

the people of Palestine have a right to

resist there is no life in Gaza um

Israel has made it their mission to make

sure that there is no life for the gazin

that are living in the Gaza Strip for 16

years the Israeli government has

suffocated Palestinians in Gaza under a

Draconian air sea and land military

blockade imprisoning and starving over 2

million people and denying them Medical

Aid so I think when we&#39;re thinking when

we&#39;re looking at a few days ago I think

it&#39;s really important to look at the

history of Palestine and contextualize

what&#39;s happening a lot of people want to

believe that this is a random moment

that happened on October 7th but

realistically speaking this is not true

this is a a building upon a military

occupation that has been happening for

75 plus years and Gaza specifically for

16 years Gazza has been under blackid

for 16 years no one can leave they&#39;ve

been denied the basic human rights of

just living a life along with having

food water fuel electricity and that&#39;s

what we&#39;re focusing on here today like I

said 16 years of Siege 16 years of being

held hostage in an open air prison where

you have been denied everything where

your family has been killed where you

have to hold your dying child and bury

them while you have to survive like we

have to look at the history ofans and

people in Palestine you&#39;ve had a series

of Wars uh 1948 was the most important

for our benefit that was when the state

of Israel was declared Arab armies

invaded uh and about 720,000 uh 720,000

Palestinians were forced to

flee um in the wake of that uh basically

the Palestinians called 1948 the

Israelis call it the war of independence

Palestinians call it the the nakba the

disaster you know and ever since then

the issue of Palestine has been on and

off the international agenda the

politicians are calling for a second

necka if you don&#39;t know what necka is it

means catastrophe it&#39;s what happened in

1948 when almost a million people were

displaced practically overnight and uh

genocide and massacres of over 250

Palestinian Villages and we&#39;re seeing

politicians not just from the Israeli

side but also the Us and other European

politicians calling for the leveling of

Gaza calling for a complete annihilation

of the Palestinian people do you think

like do you think the majority of people

in Gaza are against Hamas I would say

that that&#39;s not important I think what&#39;s

important here is condemning the

violence and the cuz I&#39;m Jewish right

and I&#39;m Israeli so I&#39;m very interested

and I have friends that are Palestinian

but somewhere in West Bank only one or

two friends from Gaza but a big concern

for us I would say is that people have

no choice like if you wanted to speak

out against Kamas would it be

essentially safe for all your family

members still living

there I don&#39;t think you&#39;re asking the

right questions I&#39;m just saying it it&#39;s

a true question because not a lot of us

would have those rights in Gaza and

that&#39;s not because of Gaza it&#39;s not

because of the great Palestinian people

that make that place it&#39;s because of

hamama

Kamas is a terrorist organization that

runs that Palestinian people didn&#39;t do

it Kamas did and they&#39;ve radicalized

their whole spot and now the time has

come that there&#39;s a second holocaust,

1300 plus people were killed that would

be equal to over 35,000 Americans if

that was in America per capita could you

just say that is [ __ ] horrible where

was the international outcry when Israel

killed more than 200 Palestinians before

the recent events in 2023 do that I&#39;m

here to speak on behalf of my people so

that I mean if the caloa cartel sliced

up everyone in Texas and New Mexico what

do you think America would do based on

what you know America to be today plus

it&#39;s not just Jews Arabs Palestinian

Arabs people from Thailand Italy Germany

a whole Music Festival do you go to
