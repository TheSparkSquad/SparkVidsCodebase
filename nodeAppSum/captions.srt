1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,520
this is MC tile over a year ago now I

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,400
had one tile to stand on and every 1,000

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,440
XP I gain unlocks a new tile I can&#39;t use

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,160
Banks or trade other players and I&#39;m

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,080
unlocking RuneScape one tile at a time

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,040
the goal runescape&#39;s biggest challenge

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,599.9999999999964
The

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:24,919.9999999999964
[Music]

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,800
Inferno we are in the final stretch

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,240.00000000000364
preparing for runescape&#39;s hardest

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,240.00000000000364
challenge and with the Rune pouch

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,759
upgrade done I have my eyes on what

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,360
could just be the final upgrade of the

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,160
series I have been putting in the

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,719
graveyard shift over at Pest Control I

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,640
spent a couple hours last night getting

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,440
200 points to spend on Range XP get

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,520
myself closer and closer to this final

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,440
level for The Inferno

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,079
750 KOA from maxing out range it&#39;s been

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,239
a long time coming there&#39;s still so much

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,359
on the to-do list before The Inferno 99

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,599.9999999999927
range 95 magic 94 hit points these are

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,079
the three musthave stats I need before I

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,680
attempt anything and they&#39;re easily

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,519
going to take up the next 50 plus hours

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
of game time I have some fun plans for

28
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,080
how to use these goals to potentially

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
get some last second Inferno upgrades

30
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,080
and whenever I have some free time I&#39;ll

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520.0000000000146
be casting some fire strikes like I did

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,759
at the start of this week for a couple

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,520
hours just an inch away at that 95 magic

34
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,560
goal it is time to get one of if not the

35
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,399.99999999998545
final upgrade of the series so many

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
things it could be honestly maybe I

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
don&#39;t even know what it is but first wo

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,119
wo you&#39;re looking like you need some

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
fuel some nice clean energy for your

40
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,119
body maybe that doesn&#39;t make you crash

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,158.99999999998545
or Jitter like some of the crappy energy

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,479
drinks out on the market you came to the

43
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,920
right place I&#39;m your local gfuel dealer

drink to fuel your grind but don&#39;t just

48
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,320.00000000001455

49
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,320
happened when I drink g-u last week

50
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,320
gamer Fu

51
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,320
baby g-u comes in so many different

52
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,439
flavors maybe even a billion I don&#39;t

53
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,079
know we have flavors like Bahama Mama

54
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,758.9999999999854
watermelon limeade and one of my

55
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,520
favorites blue ice I&#39;ve definitely drank

56
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,119
that one the most as you can see I&#39;m

57
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,000
somewhat of a collector how can you not

58
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,119
be it it tastes so good and your timing

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,360
couldn&#39;t be better with all these

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,360
spookified flavors coming out October

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,919.9999999999854

or Target you will not regret it give it

71
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,640
a shot the plan for today and maybe even

72
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,79.9999999999709
the rest of this week is to fill my

73
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,599
currently empty ring slot it just feels

74
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
like a crime to go into The Inferno

75
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,440
without any ring at all and to fill that

76
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,490
ring slot we&#39;re paying a visit to The

77
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,720
Good Old dagoth

78
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,360
[Music]

79
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,519
Kings this is my best option for a good

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
ring and at 1 and 128 the rates aren&#39;t

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,000
bad The Archers ring is good don&#39;t get

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,560
me wrong but I have my eyes set on the

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,120
Sears ring which might seem a little

84
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,680
weird but I&#39;m happy with my ranged

85
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,319.0000000000291
accuracy at this point something I think

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,519
I&#39;ll struggle with on the other hand in

87
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,040
The Inferno is Magic accuracy at the

88
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,720
start of every Inferno wave I&#39;ll be

89
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,239
sending out an ice barrage and hitting

90
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
it successfully making makes a wave

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,640.0000000000291
significantly easier and currently my

92
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,120
accuracy is roughly 78% which across 60

93
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,79.9999999999709
plus waves isn&#39;t great this Sears ring

94
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,319.0000000000291
can solve that problem when imbued a

95
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,519
Sears ring gives 12 magic accuracy

96
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,599
almost as much as wearing another pair

97
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,239
of Mystic bottoms it&#39;s that good so

98
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,679.9999999999709
we&#39;re off to the dagoth king lir it&#39;s

99
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,640.0000000000291
probably going to take over half my toss

100
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,879.0000000000291
to get down there and honestly my setup

101
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,279.9999999999709
really isn&#39;t great right now I&#39;m just

102
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,679.9999999999709
weighing this probably going to have to

103
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,360
come back with some Blood Spells cuz I

104
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,360
have like no food on me right now I just

105
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,720.0000000000291
kind of wanted to do a run instant like

106
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,760.0000000000291
halfway through the dungeon right now

107
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,439
and I&#39;ve taken so much damage I&#39;m on 48

108
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,519
health I have two food on me oh my God

109
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,519
we made it but at what cost I used all

110
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,480.0000000000291
of my food getting down here I would

111
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,120
have died had I had no food I don&#39;t know

112
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,920
why I underestimated this so

113
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,840
badly oh we are so back Supreme is busy

114
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,599
with someone can I tag Prime from here I

115
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,319.0000000000291
can what the heck that&#39;s actually such a

116
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,399.9999999999709
long range all the kings are weak

117
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,040
to a certain style and luckily Prime is

118
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,840
weak to range so it&#39;s the only one I

119
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,439
plan to kill works out perfectly for me

120
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,360
all right we&#39;re done one prime kill one

121
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,480
Sears ring here we go 865 coins pretty

122
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,159.0000000000291
close not sure how long I&#39;m going to

123
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,480
last here with three food but kills are

124
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,760
insanely Fast Five sharks okay maybe the

125
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,679.9999999999709
best drop I could have gotten apart from

126
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,880
a Sears ring itself now I can stay here

127
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,918.9999999999709
longer the respawn times are so long I

128
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,680
need food to like last until the boss

129
00:04:19,918.9999999999709 --> 00:04:23,960
respawns it should be kill number 10 but

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,919
as soon as I see anything I am out of

131
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,239.9999999999418
here cuz this is getting a little yep

132
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,080
that&#39;s a big number we&#39;re out we&#39;re out

133
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,320
we&#39;re okay get out almost got kill

134
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,039
number 10 though and now I know I can

135
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,400
bring way more anti- poisons and more

136
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,639
Blood Spells don&#39;t really need that much

137
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,239.9999999999418
prayer as always got to break the

138
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,320
Looting bag and get everything out of it

139
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
I think I&#39;ve said it before but

140
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,479
switching to ancients is the biggest

141
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,960.0000000000582
Mobility Nerf in the game for me I&#39;ve

142
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,039
unlocked almost every location in the

143
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,080
game through a Teleport or a shortcut so

144
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,199
not having those teleports or shortcuts

145
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,758.9999999999418
basically blocks me off from most of the

146
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,880
areas that I&#39;ve been in the game once I

147
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,720
switched to ancients so it&#39;s a really

148
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,840
bad Nerf for me and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t

149
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,320.0000000000582
like being on ancients but for the Sears

150
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,000
ring I will do it ancient Spellbook on

151
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,199
oh what&#39;s that oh it&#39;s me you&#39;re dagoth

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,919
Prime Champion okay Blood Spells were

153
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,919.0000000000582
worth it I

154
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:15,960.0000000000582
admit no

155
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,600
way no way 16 Kills baby let&#39;s go I was

156
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,680
ready to grind this thing out for like

157
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,280.0000000000582
12 hours today that is beautiful I think

158
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,360
this is overall the luckiest RuneScape

159
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,318.9999999999418
account I&#39;ve ever made just such

160
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,560
consistent luck can&#39;t believe how fast

161
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,680
that happened 16 skills bro let&#39;s go

162
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280.0000000000582
we&#39;re not done yet though we&#39;re going to

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,039
have to imbue this ring imbuing a ring

164
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,559.9999999999418
doubles its stats so we kind of have to

165
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,800
do it the plan is to sit at nightmare

166
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,520
Zone rilling Quest bosses for uh 6 hours

167
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,840.0000000000582
to get enough points to en the ring

168
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,680
before heading to nightmare Zone I

169
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,919
decided to do the fishing contest Quest

170
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,759
and a little bit of the recipe for

171
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,840
Disaster quest so I can get myself a

172
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,280.0000000000582
rock cake okay there we go got our Rock

173
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,359.9999999999418
cake took a little bit of time but now

174
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,880
nightmare zone is going to be a lot

175
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,360
easier can use this to get myself to 1

176
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,560
HP and then I&#39;ll sip a bunch of

177
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
absorption potions in Nightmare Zone and

178
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,240
then monsters can only hit me for one it

179
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,639
costs 4,000 points to get an absorption

180
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,840.0000000000582
potion in this mini game and 650,000

181
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,960.0000000000582
points to imbue this ring so I&#39;m going

182
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,080
to have to spend a lot of points to make

183
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,479
more points that&#39;s just how it goes I

184
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,000
guess I&#39;m about to get 6h hour logged

185
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,240
which means well I&#39;ve been at this for

186
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,960
about 6 hours and I still need about

187
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,039
250,000 points so uh I guess tack on

188
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,799.9999999999418
another 3 hours to the

189
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,080
estimate it&#39;s been a long day this

190
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,919.0000000000582
actually took a lot longer than I

191
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,159.9999999999418
remember and night Zone but the upgrade

192
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,400
is worth every hour spent Sears ring I I

193
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,440
was expecting to spend a few days

194
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,359.9999999999418
hunting the ring and imbuing it together

195
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,280
but I managed all of this in one day it

196
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,199
is pretty late but it is still the same

197
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,679.9999999999418
day so 200k away from 99 range got so

198
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,319
many things done today that was such a

199
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,639
good grind For Me overall and since

200
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,639
we&#39;re done with this rock cake I can

201
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,840.0000000000582
finish up this recipe for Disaster quest

202
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,280.0000000000582
get some uh get some XP get some chest

203
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,840
access I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really going

204
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,878.9999999999418
to help me in any way but next thing on

205
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,039
the list I&#39;m going to be killing

206
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,639
chickens here until I get 50,000

207
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,599
feathers this is grind I haven&#39;t really

208
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,599
been looking forward to all

209
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:11,559.9999999999418
that 99 range baby it&#39;s been a long long

210
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,960
time coming first skill Cape first 99 on

211
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,879
the account and of course one of the

212
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,039
three Inferno stats I needed I basically

213
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,280.0000000000582
just spent a bunch of time doing Pest

214
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,120
Control since the combat achievements

215
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,758.9999999999418
have made getting points really fast and

216
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,160
it requires very little attention the

217
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,400.0000000000582
long long awaited skill Cape first one

218
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,599.0000000000582
on the account and it&#39;s green just like

219
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,679.9999999999418
my tiles the perk of this cape is it

220
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,520
acts exactly like an accumulator so it

221
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,879
saves my ammo but I&#39;m going to be honest

222
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,080
it&#39;s not that good until I get another

223
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,720
99 that&#39;ll trim the cape and give it

224
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,919
some pretty good stats so I might have

225
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,560
to wait for that before it&#39;s worth using

226
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,599
but that&#39;s another Inferno requirement

227
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,199
off the list two to go okay Real Talk

228
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,680
two major things left to take care of

229
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,520.0000000000582
and they&#39;re way more important than 99

230
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,759
range as cool as that was this will be a

231
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,680
long week for me 95 magic is not only

232
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,720
the grindi thing remaining but also the

233
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,599
most expensive I do have a ton of money

234
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,400.0000000000582
from Gauntlet but I&#39;ll need plenty of

235
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,159
money for The Inferno itself so I need

236
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,960
to be a little careful with my spending

237
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,680
and I have a plan to potentially get

238
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,000
another really cool upgrade if we get

239
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,120
lucky enough I have 27 prayer pluss left

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
uh I&#39;m going to make them last as long

241
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,240
as possible but I&#39;m using every last one

242
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,319
on Magic XP I&#39;m just going to burst dust

243
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,639
devils until I&#39;m flat broke b almost 600

244
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,440
Browns knives should be enough for dust

245
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,110
devils amazing news guys 91 magic four

246
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,560
levels to

247
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:27,639
[Music]

248
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:29,759
go no a I wasn&#39;t paying any attention no

249
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,440
a getting back there is super annoying

250
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,640
especially on the ancient spell book

251
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,120
there goes 40 minutes of my time today

252
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,718.9999999999418
my 27 prayer potions got used up real

253
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,279
fast and before I knew it I had to

254
00:08:37,719.0000000000582 --> 00:08:41,279
resort to other methods of hitting this

255
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,559.9999999999418
95 magic goal I did a lot of different

256
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,640
things from teleporting to fire blasting

257
00:08:43,559.9999999999418 --> 00:08:47,399
to aling and even killing hell hounds

258
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,880
for hard clue Scrolls because I did want

259
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,720
to try my hand at getting another

260
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,040
Inferno upgrade and will definitely

261
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,839
revisit this soon there&#39;s 92 magic

262
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,319.9999999998836
beautiful three to go by the time I hit

263
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,279.0000000001164
93 magic with over 25 plus hours

264
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,79.00000000011642
invested in this grind in particular I

265
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,399
was down hard from the 26 mil I started

266
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,399
the week with everyone doubted me and

267
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,480
here I am with 93 magic I&#39;m not going to

268
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,279
provide any sources as to who doubted me

269
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
but uh we do still have two levels to go

270
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,880
and the funds are kind of running a bit

271
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,560.0000000001164
low 17 mil is still a lot of cash but at

272
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,680
this point uh it is what it is 94 magic

273
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,239.99999999988358
long time coming and in theory this

274
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,279
could be good enough for The Inferno but

275
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,440
one little monster specifically this

276
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,240
silly little bat has a chance to drain

277
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,399
my stats and if I&#39;m drained below 94

278
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,920
magic I can&#39;t can&#39;t freeze things and

279
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,680
that&#39;s a risk that could jeopardize a

280
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
run and I can&#39;t be having that so we&#39;re

281
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,079
reaching for one more magic level and I

282
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,640
know exactly how I want to do it because

283
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,680
I finally have a ton of tiles prepared

284
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,920
for a big clue scroll session this is

285
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,800
what I was waiting for 3500 tiles to

286
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,040
work with hard clue completion rate is

287
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,680
not good but with this many tiles I can

288
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,959
probably bump it up by a couple percent

289
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,359.9999999998836
and hopefully get some completions

290
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,920
hopefully get a last minute Inferno gear

291
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,519
upgrade at this point there&#39;s not a ton

292
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,319.9999999998836
of slots that I could realistically

293
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,000
upgrade except for three of them them

294
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,600
boots gloves and ammo all three of these

295
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,040
could be upgraded from a hard clue

296
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800.0000000001164
scroll and each of them has six

297
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,439.9999999998836
potential upgrade options all of these

298
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,040
potential upgrades increase my prayer

299
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,839
bonus which in my opinion is the

300
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,199.99999999988358
greatest currency in The Inferno I only

301
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959.0000000001164
have 10 prayer bonus with my current

302
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,160.00000000011642
setup which could definitely be improved

303
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,959
and that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re going to

304
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,000
try to do on this hard clue scroll hunt

305
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,880
and in the meantime we have 700k magic

306
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,519
XP left to finish off 95 magic so why

307
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
not I&#39;m well aware there are many better

308
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,040
things I could be doing for clue Scrolls

309
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,640
right now but I just want to do this so

310
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,199.99999999988358
let&#39;s go it&#39;s been a while hard clue

311
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,640
what&#39;s the first step shallow Village

312
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,240
ckr very doable let&#39;s do it okay so the

313
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,439.9999999998836
second step is Wilderness it&#39;s not that

314
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,920
far from the canoe I unlocked and since

315
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
my whole thing right now is completing

316
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,760
hard Clues I am down to risk this one by

317
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
risk it I mean I&#39;m just going to die in

318
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,920
Edgeville and all my stuff is going to

319
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,200
stay here I&#39;ve avoided doing this in the

320
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,880
past because I don&#39;t want to do it for

321
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,720
every single Wilderness step but since

322
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
our entire goal right now is to complete

323
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,720
hard Clues I can&#39;t really avoid them

324
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,639
it&#39;s like a one in five shot that you

325
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,800.0000000001164
get a Wilderness step on a hard clue so

326
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,320
I I just I kind of have to to suck it up

327
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,359.9999999998836
and start unlocking them start doing

328
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,839
them Maple Sho coming in clutch the

329
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,480
weapon of Champions uh let&#39;s see if this

330
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,440
oh a looting bag that&#39;s actually pretty

331
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,480
nice so I want to have to get another

332
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,880.0000000001164
one later another step and another

333
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,839
Wilderness clue this is what I&#39;m talking

334
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,639
about they&#39;re just so common that I&#39;m

335
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,800.0000000001164
kind of forced to do them so I&#39;ll be

336
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,600
storing my stuff at Edgeville and just

337
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,199.99999999988358
going into these Wilderness Clues I mean

338
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
it&#39;s like 30 minutes every time I have

339
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,79.00000000011642
to do that but makes me wonder what it&#39;s

340
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,920.0000000001164
like to play with a bank these days I

341
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,560
forget sometimes that 99.99% of players

342
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,319.9999999998836
can just Bank their things and then go

343
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,359.9999999998836
into the Wilderness and do a clue it&#39;s

344
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,720
just not a big deal I forget about that

345
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,279
stuff never in a million years did I

346
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,279
think I&#39;d be completing this agility

347
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,439.9999999998836
course on this account another Brave

348
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,839
wizard taken from this world step number

349
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,959.0000000001164
four another doable one this could be

350
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,680.0000000001164
the final one too uh I can go pick up my

351
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,760
stuff cuz this is not a dangerous one

352
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,079
that should be good for now I grabbed

353
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,240
most of my stuff I&#39;ll come back for the

354
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,800
rest of it after we finish this step and

355
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,639
another step step number

356
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,359.9999999998836
five okay so for this one we need two

357
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,240
different quests we need Merlin&#39;s

358
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,480
Crystal and and holy grail uh I&#39;m going

359
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
to go take care of those then that&#39;s

360
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,560.0000000001164
going to take like an hour to do these

361
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,120
two quests but afterward we should most

362
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,719.9999999998836
likely get a casket so very challenging

363
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,199
Quest Merlin&#39;s Crystal done now we just

364
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,320
need to do Holy Grail and we&#39;re good to

365
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:18,959
go we&#39;re not even done with the quest

366
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,480
here yet and we get another step okay

367
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,839
thank God I can do it I was about to be

368
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,519
really really upset if I couldn&#39;t do

369
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,320
this step getting blocked on step six

370
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,320
would have been so miserable but uh we

371
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,360
are guaranteed a casket here and not

372
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,240
only that but holy grail completed got a

373
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,199.00000000011642
lot of XP from that Quest genuinely very

374
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,399
good reward for that yes there it is

375
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:37,880
baby six step hard clue we went through

376
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,320
a lot to do that and I am so excited to

377
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,720
see the reward it&#39;s been a while since

378
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,440
I&#39;ve done a hard clue so many upgrades

379
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,440
we could get from

380
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,518.9999999998836
this it&#39;s um I mean I&#39;ll it&#39;s some money

381
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,319.9999999998836
I can&#39;t really save this one it&#39;s just a

382
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,839
bad clue I got to do the bar crawl for

383
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,800.0000000001164
this step which means I got to go visit

384
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,360
like 11 bars in RuneScape that&#39;s going

385
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,839
to be pretty expensive tile wise but

386
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,800.0000000001164
that&#39;s what they&#39;re for right and I have

387
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,600
to drop this I can&#39;t uh I can&#39;t do this

388
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,359.9999999998836
clue no matter what unfortunately can&#39;t

389
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,160
do anything to grind it out it&#39;s just a

390
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,680.0000000001164
it&#39;s just a lock it&#39;s time to level up

391
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,079
in the world of hard Clues I&#39;m getting

392
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,160
back on the ancient spell book we&#39;re

393
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,880
about to burst some jellies because they

394
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,839
have an insane hard clue rate and if I

395
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,160
can kill like what Seven 8 nine at a

396
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,720
time we&#39;re going to be getting them so

397
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,040
much faster I don&#39;t have any prayer

398
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,440
potions but I&#39;m just going to be prayer

399
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,959
flicking the entire time at least as

400
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,160.00000000011642
much as I can and this should be way

401
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,279
faster for getting clues boom Oh my God

402
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,760
that was so fast 5 minutes 5 minutes for

403
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,760
a hard clue

404
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,680.0000000001164
and step number five yes another hard

405
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,120
clue completed let&#39;s go I&#39;m so excited

406
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,479.9999999998836
it&#39;s just I don&#39;t get to complete them

407
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,120
very often and we get uh black di body

408
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,880
Rune skirt I mean just a bunch of

409
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,600
alchables again I mean it is what it is

410
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,839
that&#39;s kind of how hard Clues go hoping

411
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,959.0000000001164
for a better tomorrow with uh with

412
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,759
actual uniques 18 that I can get that

413
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,839
can help me I I have faith I have faith

414
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,320
that I&#39;m going to get one of them this

415
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,720
will be the longest hard clue step I&#39;ve

416
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,519
ever unlocked uh clocking in at just

417
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,440
over 500 tiles just to get to one little

418
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,160
place okay and we have another completed

419
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,160.00000000011642
hard clue beautiful let&#39;s see what we

420
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,920
get from

421
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,880
this oh it looked so promising look at

422
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,880
how many unique four uniques in that

423
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,240
clue I know it&#39;s a long shot for an

424
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,120
upgrade but I that that does look good

425
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,560.0000000001164
for uniques in a clue can&#39;t complain

426
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,720
about that that&#39;s pretty sick things you

427
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,399
love to see another hard clue on the

428
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,880
ground no things you hate to see an

429
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,759
impossible step oh oh I&#39;ve been waiting

430
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,360
for this it&#39;s been 3 weeks since I got

431
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,000
my first stamina potion that&#39;s my second

432
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,240
stamina potion for The Inferno now

433
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,600
beautiful doing a little detour I

434
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,920
decided to get the items for this medium

435
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,680.0000000001164
clue step and I&#39;m going to build the

436
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,519
stash unit here so that I can complete

437
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,959
it in the future medium Clues also have

438
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,720
about eight potential upgrades for The

439
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,079
Inferno so they are still worth doing

440
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,519
but I&#39;m going to stick to hards for the

441
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,199
most part I think tomorrow I&#39;m going to

442
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,560.0000000001164
stack a couple easy medium and hard

443
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,719.9999999998836
caskets just so we can have a big

444
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,959
opening with all of them I think that

445
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,120
would be really fun and we get the

446
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,638.9999999998836
medium casket nice this clue actually

447
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,920
took over an hour because I had to get a

448
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,480
a lot of different items for it let&#39;s

449
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,719.9999999998836
see what we get uh armad page 4 we did

450
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,199.00000000011642
get a unique just not what we were

451
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,800.0000000001164
looking for fair game so I&#39;ve once again

452
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,519
run into a bit of a roadblock I need to

453
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,880
finish fairy tale part two for this next

454
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,279
step and that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m going

455
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,360
to go do might as well just unlock it

456
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,199
permanently so I&#39;ll see you in an hour

457
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,360
luckily I did have most of this Quest

458
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,719.9999999998836
area already unlocked so we do get some

459
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,399
herblore XP and a little lamp that I&#39;m

460
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,000
just going to also use on herblore I

461
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,000
think no I can&#39;t do the next

462
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,360
step I started the next morning by

463
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,000
getting a couple medium Clues an easy

464
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,920
clue and a hard clue and trying to

465
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,120
complete all of them for one big opening

466
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,639
session I was able to complete two

467
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,360
medium Clues this morning and this

468
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,759
should be the final step of this easy

469
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,680.0000000001164
clue the only thing we can get from

470
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,720
easys are blessings that&#39;s our easy clue

471
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,199
completed and we have one step remaining

472
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,79.00000000011642
on this hard clue so we&#39;re going to have

473
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,279
four caskets to open I&#39;m pretty excited

474
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,638.9999999998836
turned out to be a really good idea to

475
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,319
get that fairy tale part two done

476
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,959.0000000001164
because it&#39;s my last step on this hard

477
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:54,680
clue with medium Clues on the table now

478
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,560
we can hope for either Ranger boots or

479
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,758.9999999998836
holy sandals as a big buff to The

480
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,800
Inferno setup rolling a useful boot pair

481
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,639
is extremely unlikely though to say the

482
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,719.9999999998836
least got the hard casket which means we

483
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,759
have four caskets to open honestly not

484
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,480
bad odds not not terrible odds of

485
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,040
getting something here start with the

486
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,880
easy clue not very high hopes for this

487
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,079
one but honestly that&#39;s a lot of money

488
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,160
for an easy clue that&#39;s probably three

489
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,758.9999999998836
times the average you can expect from an

490
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,040
easy moving on to the

491
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:31,000
mediums no

492
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:33,839
way no way I&#39;m in disbel five five Clues

493
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,560
five mediums for that that&#39;s like the

494
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,759
best pair of boots I could have gotten

495
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,719.9999999998836
for The

496
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:44,199.00000000011642
Inferno what is that luck on clue number

497
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,720
five what is going on and I still have

498
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:48,758.9999999998836
two more caskets to open okay uh let&#39;s

499
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,920.0000000001164
let&#39;s open another one uh we get a

500
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,79.00000000011642
sariden page some runes not really that

501
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,000
interesting it&#39;s really hard to top that

502
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:57,279
to be fair really really hard to top

503
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,040
that clue and we have our hard casket to

504
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,360
finish it up the the pirate hat okay

505
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,079
what a clue session I actually want to

506
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,160.00000000011642
keep this hat so bad I think I will it&#39;s

507
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,918.9999999998836
it&#39;s just lovely I mean look at me I was

508
00:17:08,160.00000000011642 --> 00:17:12,160.00000000011642
going to grind way more clues but this

509
00:17:09,919.0000000001164 --> 00:17:14,720
is as good as it gets um I can&#39;t beat

510
00:17:12,160.00000000011642 --> 00:17:16,559
holy sandals these are such a good pull

511
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
unlike Ranger boots or God deide boots

512
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,240
they don&#39;t give any negative magic

513
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,760
attack bonus so in my opinion these are

514
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,319
the best boots I could have gotten well

515
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,199.00000000011642
I guess we can go ahead and Al all the

516
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,559
stuff we don&#39;t need wa how did that

517
00:17:27,199.00000000011642 --> 00:17:32,280
happen all right enough of that 95 magic

518
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,520
Inferno stat number two completed one

519
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,960
final level on the agenda before we are

520
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,600
good to go and that&#39;s 94 hit points and

521
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,890
you know what I think I know just the

522
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:45,399.99999999976717
way to grind this level

523
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:48,120.00000000023283
[Music]

524
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,919
out it&#39;s been 9 months since I first

525
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,639.9999999997672
killed Z on this account and it was

526
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,679
pretty difficult back then with the gear

527
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,960
we were working with nowadays things are

528
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,480
a little different I am really geared

529
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,400
out to grind this boss Zora holds one

530
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,600
amazing Inferno upgrade and that&#39;s the

531
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,559.0000000002328
blowpipe I talked about it 9 months ago

532
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,480
and it remains as relevant today as it

533
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,360
did before it&#39;s not a necessity but it

534
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,159
has so many cases in The Inferno that

535
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,439.99999999976717
are so useful the special attack can

536
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,559.0000000002328
heal you it&#39;s double the speed of the

537
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,679
BofA so it&#39;s great for low HP and low

538
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,360
defense targets ultimately it would just

539
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,240
be really good to have even though it&#39;s

540
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,320
been 9 months since I&#39;ve done Zora on

541
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,159
this account the main inconveniences of

542
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
the boss have stayed the same throughout

543
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,919
all this time I&#39;m still going to have to

544
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,480
make my own rings of recoil I&#39;m still

545
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,320.00000000023283
going to have to go buy anti- poisons

546
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,360.00000000023283
every trip so that stuff definitely

547
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,120
still limits my kills per hour like a

548
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,399.99999999976717
huge amount this time around the luxury

549
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,158.99999999976717
I have is my gear is good enough that I

550
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,400
think I can get kills with much less

551
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,280.00000000023283
food so I&#39;m going to be making five or

552
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,919
six rings of recoil and I&#39;ll just keep

553
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,960
them in my inventory so that I don&#39;t

554
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,520.0000000002328
have to make them as often as I did last

555
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
time I&#39;m hoping this gear is good enough

556
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,559
to just consistently get kills with a

557
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,000
lower amount of food I don&#39;t even have

558
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,799
any switches or anything I&#39;m just going

559
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,400
in with this range setup and I&#39;ll be

560
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,280
ranging every single phase even the ones

561
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,320.00000000023283
that aren&#39;t weak to range as anticipated

562
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,639.9999999997672
the bow is just ripping nonstop it

563
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,840
really doesn&#39;t matter that I have no

564
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,640
switches it doesn&#39;t matter that I&#39;m

565
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,280
attacking with the same style on every

566
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,760
phase zor is so much fun in this gear I

567
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,120
can definitely see myself staying here a

568
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,120
while because it&#39;s just so free like

569
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,039
it&#39;s just so insanely free with this

570
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,760
setup our first kill back and we get uh

571
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,640
honestly a pretty good drop I will take

572
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,480
that I like the battle staffs 3 minute

573
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,280.00000000023283
kill actually a bit long I think we

574
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,760
we&#39;ll probably be averaging like 2 and

575
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,918.9999999997672
1/2 minute kill or so boom just like

576
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,440
that absolutely shattered the PB 2

577
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,270.00000000023283
minutes 11 and an insane drop 70 Manas

578
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:43,049
is so good for

579
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:43,049
[Music]

580
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,320
me what is that drop I just got a loop

581
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,200
and tooth half in one drop and from the

582
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,439.99999999976717
first Crystal key on the account we get

583
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,240
uh nothing great uh pretty

584
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:00,799
[Music]

585
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:04,039
standard oh my God no way 44 kills

586
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,720
that&#39;s insane actually the second best

587
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,400
drop I could have gotten obviously the

588
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,440
blowpipe would have been amazing to get

589
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,840.0000000002328
this so early is so important I never

590
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,200
need anti-poison to kill zra ever again

591
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,080
I have permanent immunity to poison and

592
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,919
Venom this is a godsend drop for this

593
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,559
grind so good genuinely such an amazing

594
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,159
drop to get I&#39;m losing a little bit of

595
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,360
DPS since I&#39;m not wearing the crystal

596
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,280.00000000023283
Helm but to not be worried about getting

597
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,678.9999999997672
poisoned I think is so much bigger than

598
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,240
that see I can put the crystal Helm on

599
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,880
during phases where I absolutely can&#39;t

600
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,720
be poisoned I&#39;m getting like 8 to n

601
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,679
kills per hour right now but with no

602
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,440
more stops for anti-p poisons we could

603
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,240
be getting an extra kill per hour now

604
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,880
that&#39;s a PB 145 what a nice PB ooh you

605
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,240
know I&#39;ve been thinking about this I&#39;ve

606
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,679
been uh I was expecting to get one of

607
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,039
these eventually I can do this step

608
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,120.00000000023283
actually I&#39;m going to go try to do this

609
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,559
but I&#39;ve never completed an elite clue

610
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,918.9999999997672
on this account the odds are insanely

611
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,760
low I just with these restrictions and

612
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,159
my stats it&#39;s just not a high

613
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,879.9999999997672
probability but it would be really

614
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,600.0000000002328
really cool just to say I&#39;ve done one on

615
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,679
this account so I will be attempting

616
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,559
every single Elite clue I get from zoraa

617
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,360.00000000023283
and maybe just maybe we can complete one

618
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,879.9999999997672
string of youu Longbow that is maybe one

619
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,760
of the worst ones I could have gotten if

620
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,39.00000000023283
I still had the money I actually would

621
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:19,000
spend it on Fletching but I&#39;m down to 6

622
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,000
and 1 12 mil so we&#39;ll get more we&#39;ll get

623
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,859
[Music]

624
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
more

625
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,399.99999999976717
oh I can get the combat task here please

626
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,399.99999999976717
yes oh my

627
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,799
god I&#39;ve been trying to get that combat

628
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,960
task for so long and we get another

629
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,440
Elite clue let&#39;s go see if we can do

630
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,600.0000000002328
this one got another super deep

631
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,799
Wilderness step these Elite Clues could

632
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,320
rob me of every tile I have there&#39;s so

633
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,679
many steps that I don&#39;t have unlocked

634
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,399.99999999976717
that would take 6 or 7,000 more tiles

635
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,159
okay please just be a casket this is

636
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,240
Step six no please oh it&#39;s a Sherlock

637
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,640
step this could be so bad I want to say

638
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,159
there&#39;s only about 30% of Sherlock steps

639
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,400
that I can complete right now which is

640
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,799.0000000002328
not the the odds do not favor me here

641
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,320.00000000023283
this is Step number seven please be

642
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:18,120
humble no no not that I have literally

643
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,720
one Rune crafting that is it&#39;s step

644
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,840
seven bro it&#39;s step

645
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,480
seven the worst skill for me it&#39;s

646
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,720
literally I have zero XP dude how long

647
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,320
is 44 Rune crafting I&#39;d have to go to

648
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,880
library that&#39;s like I don&#39;t know 10 11

649
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,918.9999999997672
hours do I want to invest that amount of

650
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,600.0000000002328
time into all right there&#39;s 44 Rune

651
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,000
crafting what I was always going to get

652
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,240
it this actually ended up being more

653
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
like 15 hours by the way I didn&#39;t think

654
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,440
it would take this long but there are

655
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,520
just some things in this world that you

656
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,720
have to do 15 hours of run crafting

657
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,480
later nature Rune made although that&#39;s

658
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,919
the first Rune I&#39;ve actually Rune

659
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,039
crafted I&#39;ve did everything through

660
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,039
Library so by the way this was my first

661
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,000
time training Rune crafting in over 5

662
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:05,200
years this is why you do it for this

663
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,760
view this is why you do it right here

664
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,840.0000000002328
potentially the only Elite clue I&#39;ll

665
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,080
complete on this account Let&#39;s uh see

666
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,520
what we get

667
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,000
um it&#39;s it&#39;s about what I expected

668
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,279
honestly it would have been cool to see

669
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,080
a cool unique but you know what honestly

670
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:21,799
no regrets that&#39;s a bucket list item we

671
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,439.99999999976717
take it I&#39;ve been at zorao for 2 days

672
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,600
now with one unique at 44 kill count

673
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,360.00000000023283
we&#39;re getting close to hitting the rate

674
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,719.9999999997672
for another and I&#39;ve decided to set a

675
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,320
hard C at 250 zra kills if I don&#39;t get

676
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,400
the blowpipe by then I&#39;ll be stepping

677
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,559
into The Inferno without it and just

678
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,360.00000000023283
trying my luck every time I die at Z

679
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,720
it&#39;s about a 30 minute time waste I have

680
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,719.9999999997672
to uh buy runes over here just so I can

681
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,400
get back to the Charter I have to do two

682
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,440
trips to get my stuff back so it&#39;s just

683
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,679
very costly time wise to die you really

684
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,159
don&#39;t want to die number 140 for a

685
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,559.0000000002328
dragon hird we need the money honestly I

686
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,520.0000000002328
don&#39;t know what happened man my money

687
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,520
just evaporated 150 KC and we get zoraa

688
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,279
master that&#39;s all right that&#39;s actually

689
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,039
a big combat achievement for me Five

690
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,799
Points I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m super close

691
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,559
to the medium combat achievements now

692
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,158.99999999976717
very close to the mediums actually 18

693
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:08,760
points away just for a little bit of a

694
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:10,880
break I&#39;m going to go kill giant mole

695
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,760
for some combat tasks because I&#39;m so

696
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,240
close to the mediums and I can easily

697
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,679
get a couple points here decided to kill

698
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,840
the easiest boss in the game for five

699
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,120.00000000023283
more points I just kind of want to

700
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,918.9999999997672
finish off the mediums before The

701
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,360
Inferno I it&#39;s just so close at this

702
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,520.0000000002328
point that I kind of want to do it 156

703
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,080
we need the death runes good good drop

704
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,000
we&#39;re up to 7K death runes in the Rune

705
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,960
pouch I&#39;m collecting those as much as I

706
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,960
can entering day four of zra I was

707
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,080
officially going dry for a second unique

708
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,360.00000000023283
and approaching my hard cap of 250 kills

709
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,879.9999999997672
on the bright side I&#39;m up almost 3,000

710
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,559
death runes since starting this grind

711
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,240
and I&#39;m getting very close to 94 hit

712
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,799
points which was one of the main points

713
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,640
of this wow what a drop eight teleports

714
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,760
that&#39;s so good for me that speeds up my

715
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,360.00000000023283
kill so much I said I would go to 250

716
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,960
but if I don&#39;t get a unique by 250 then

717
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,678.9999999997672
I think I&#39;m just going to go until I get

718
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,240
another unique drop because I think it

719
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,039
would be sad to end with only one battle

720
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,960
stabs and teleports though nice pretty

721
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:04,600
good

722
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,320
drop oh my God that&#39;s a unique but not

723
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,760
what I was looking for

724
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,200
no no I can&#39;t even make any jewelry out

725
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,640
of it dude my crafting level&#39;s too low

726
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,720
that&#39;s such a sad one to get that&#39;s the

727
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,720
saddest unique you can get I was uh I

728
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,840
was 200 kills on the Dot from our Ser

729
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,240
Helm 200 kills for the Onyx I guess I

730
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,399
will be stopping at 250 then I did get

731
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,120.00000000023283
the second unique after all so I&#39;m going

732
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:31,719.9999999997672
to get these last six kills done maybe

733
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,600
we get a miracle drop here okay it all

734
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,279
ends here took the full 4 days to get

735
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,080
250 kills I want to say over 30 hours to

736
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,440
get this kill count the Ser is nice I&#39;m

737
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,240
still happy I&#39;m going to keep the Ser

738
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,399
Helm but uh this is what the Looting bag

739
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,440
is looking like right now I got a bunch

740
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:46,678.9999999997672
of Snap Dragons from zra which at least

741
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,960
that&#39;s a really nice thing that&#39;s going

742
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,880
to be more Super restores for The

743
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,440
Inferno which is great and I also got a

744
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,80.00000000023283
bunch of death runes I think I ended up

745
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,200
getting around 7K death runes from this

746
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,240
grind so tons of great things a lot of

747
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,80.00000000023283
great benefits it&#39;s not necessar only

748
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,840
the blowpipe that helps me out here

749
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,480
definitely a lot of conveniences that I

750
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,799
could get that would make Zora twice as

751
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,240
fast three times as fast but we worked

752
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,440
with what we could after finishing up

753
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,399
our 4day Zora grind I decided it was

754
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,440
time to tie up some loose ends and

755
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:15,879.9999999997672
that&#39;s what I spent an entire day doing

756
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,120.00000000023283
I made back a decent portion of my money

757
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,200
by selling my Zora drops I took the 200

758
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,799
noted dragon bones I got from Zora and

759
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
decided to use them on the Wilderness

760
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,279
alter and got over 990,000 prayer XP

761
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,80.00000000023283
leaving me really close to 70 prayer I

762
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,640
got my first hisor Kill from combat

763
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,320
achievements and ended up finishing the

764
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,919
medium tier and we get 71 her blur from

765
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,600
the lamp let&#39;s go with the medium combat

766
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:36,559.0000000002328
achievements completed I was now getting

767
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,559
an extra two points per Pest Control

768
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,840
game allowing me to very easily finish

769
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,520
off 94 hit points and racking up just

770
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,720
enough points for one final level I

771
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,360
can&#39;t believe I&#39;m about to enter The

772
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,640
Inferno 70 prayer that is the last level

773
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,799
I&#39;m getting all my loose ends tied up

774
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,159
all my levels gotten I am entirely ready

775
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,399
uh that was it so it all comes down to

776
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:02,440
this with just under 2,000 hours of play

777
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:05,399
time on the account unlocking RuneScape

778
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,360.00000000023283
one tile at a time it&#39;s finally time to

779
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:09,439.99999999976717
beat runescape&#39;s biggest challenge I&#39;ve

780
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,719.9999999997672
been waiting to say those words and I&#39;ll

781
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,720
see you in the

782
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:23,840
[Music]

783
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
finale
