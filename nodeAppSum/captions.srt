1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,520.0000000000009
uh anti-Semitism as we know is a hatred

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,920
uh and Prejudice and racism towards

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,599
Jewish people and their faith and their

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,800
ethnicity uh anti-zionism is um a

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,440.0000000000018
movement fighting against the occupation

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,120.00000000000182
this is a settler Colonial fascist

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,799
regime that we&#39;re seeing attempting to

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,840
wipe out an entire indigenous uh

9
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:20,160
civilian population and your perspective

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,720
what is Zionism 75 years of brutal

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,640
occupation ethnic cleansing apartheid

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,960
and colonization of the Palestinian

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,279
people and and the occupation and the

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,800
OCC

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,160
Israel is a Zionist State and I think

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,199.99999999999272
that&#39;s what we really have to focus on

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,239
today yeah hello my name is sta um I&#39;m

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879.0000000000073
proud of the Palestinian youth movement

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,599.9999999999927
and we&#39;re here with the Palestinian and

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,120
Arab youth in the diaspora as well as

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,480.0000000000073
our solidarity allies demanding the uh

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,120
The Siege and end on Gaza and for the

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,599.9999999999927
blockade to be lifted where they have

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,000
been under blockade for 16 years um

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,399
where they&#39;ve been denied the basic

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,960
human rights of just living a life along

27
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,760
with having food water fuel electricity

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,359
and we&#39;re here also to talk about the 75

29
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,759.9999999999927
years of military occupation that

30
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,640
Palestine has been under since 1948

31
00:01:04,760.0000000000073 --> 00:01:08,159
people need to see the Palestinians for

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
who they are part of a revolutionary

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,640
struggle for Liberation we understand

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,000
Zionism to be a form of white supremacy

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,920
and the people have a right to resist

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,400
their occupiers by any means necessary

37
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,200
what do you think about Hamas uh I will

38
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,840
not um that you&#39;re not asking the right

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,000
questions it&#39;s the wrong question I

40
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,960.0000000000146
think that to we can&#39;t um we can&#39;t

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,439
equate the colonizer with the colonized

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,320
we can&#39;t equate the occupier with the

43
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,399.99999999998545
occupied it implies that these are equal

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,079
parties and it&#39;s not equal

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,479
so you feel like violence is a reaction

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,079
to oppression yes but they also have the

47
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,240
moral right to defend themselves against

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,559.9999999999854
their colonizers and their occupiers and

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,559.9999999999854
this is something that we really need to

50
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,399
focus on as media and instead of

51
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,360
painting Palestinians and dehumanizing

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,320.00000000001455
them and demonizing them and putting all

53
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,000
these anti-arab and anti-muslim tropes

54
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,360
against them which the West has been

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,040
imposing to justify the ethnic cleansing

56
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,960
that Israel has already done and will

57
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,320.00000000001455
continue to do so this is something that

58
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,079
we need to focus on and see the

59
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,398.99999999998545
Palestinians are there defending

60
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,079
themselves as part of revolutionary

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
struggle for Liberation we need our

62
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,318.99999999998545
countries back that&#39;s

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,920.0000000000146
it free free Palestine uh from the land

64
00:02:09,318.99999999998545 --> 00:02:12,879
what is it from the land to the Sea

65
00:02:10,919.9999999999854 --> 00:02:14,518.9999999999709
Palestine will be free from the river to

66
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,239
the sea from The River To The Sea that&#39;s

67
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,560
right yeah from The River To The Sea

68
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,519
Palestine will be free Rockets were

69
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,760
fired into Israel as gunmen infiltrated

70
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,239
several border towns and bases they

71
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,519
swarmed into Israel by land sea and even

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:36,200.0000000000291
on paragliders and then they went on a

73
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,200.0000000000291
rampage slaughtering civilians in the

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,040
street it was a it&#39;s a horrible

75
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,319.0000000000291
situation yeah and it was the worst day

76
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,799.9999999999709
in Jewish history in terms of deaths

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,000
since the Holocaust 1300 people died and

78
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,840
what can you tell us about what&#39;s going

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,800
on well uh the rage goes all the way

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,400
back I mean basically what we have is we

81
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,200.0000000000291
have two nationalist movements that are

82
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,640.0000000000291
buying for control over a piece of

83
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,760
territory Hamas is in charge of the Gaza

84
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,238.9999999999709
Strip which is in the south of Israel on

85
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,798.9999999999709
the coast uh it was founded in 1987

86
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,319.0000000000291
during the first Uprising against

87
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:09,319.0000000000291
Israeli

88
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,680
occupation Hamas won elections actually

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,640.0000000000291
in 2006 and then took over the Gaza

90
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,159.0000000000291
Strip in 2017 hamas&#39;s Charter said that

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,760
uh all of Palestine should be an Islamic

92
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:27,120
State on a core level it uh believes

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,359.9999999999709
that Palestine is a gift of God it&#39;s a

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,799
religious endowment and that they really

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,599.0000000000291
can&#39;t surrender any part of that

96
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,439
religious Endowment for Jews it was a

97
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,560
place that um has been remembered in you

98
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,799
know Jewish prayer and Jewish history

99
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,159
the Jews actually had a kingdom there uh

100
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,200.0000000000291
under David and Solomon and uh were

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,120
there until the Romans threw them out

102
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,359.9999999999709
and so the idea was the restoration of

103
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,360
the community back to its ancestral land

104
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,280
and so therefore what we see is two

105
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,319.0000000000291
groups that are vying for control over a

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,400
single small area actually about the

107
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,679.9999999999709
size of New Jersey the thing about Gaza

108
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,879.0000000000291
which you know your audience should know

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,40.000000000029104
is that Gaza is a extraordinarily

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,000
crowded one of the most crowded places

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,040
on Earth extraordinarily poor society in

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,160.0000000000291
which you know about half the population

113
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,839.9999999999709
is under the age of 18 so any Israeli

114
00:04:16,160.0000000000291 --> 00:04:19,639
incursion into Gaza is going to be

115
00:04:17,839.9999999999709 --> 00:04:21,599.9999999999709
killing a lot of children if you&#39;re

116
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,320
living in Gaza are you allowed to travel

117
00:04:21,600.0000000000291 --> 00:04:27,320.0000000000582
freely throughout Israel no can you just

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,880
go for like the weekend no no you can&#39;t

119
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,479
go to the West Bank either you&#39;re you&#39;re

120
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,280
pretty much isolated in Gaza wait so can

121
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,758.9999999999418
you is there an airport no okay so in

122
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,559.9999999999418
order to be able to cross from one to

123
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,440
another you have to go through

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,320
checkpoints and uh it&#39;s not a free

125
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,719.9999999999418
movement to Travelers one of my students

126
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,880
for example was a Palestinian from Gaza

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,560
and uh Palestinians have to be back in

128
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,800
the territories at nightfall uh they

129
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,240
can&#39;t stay in Israel proper so uh he had

130
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,080
to actually camp out in the West Bank to

131
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,360
go to university in the West Bank in

132
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,840
spite of the fact that his home was in

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,960.0000000000582
Gaza because he couldn&#39;t pass through

134
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,000
Israel in order to uh go from one to the

135
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,280
other and that curfew is imposed by

136
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,280
Israel by Israel why well that&#39;s a

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,159.9999999999418
question for the Israelis actually uh

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,599.9999999999418
the Israelis think that you know uh the

139
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,160
uh Palestinians are are

140
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,80.00000000005821
dangerous um there was a second Uprising

141
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,479.0000000000582
that took place in 2000 against Israeli

142
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,639
occupation uh and it was extraordinarily

143
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,400
bloody

144
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,280.0000000000582
do you have family in Palestine yes I do

145

146
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,359.9999999999418

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,600

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:54,319
life deadly retribution is raining down

152
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,479.0000000000582
on Gaza Israel says it&#39;s targeting Mass

153
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,479.0000000000582
with waves of air

154
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,318.9999999999418
strikes

155
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,599.9999999999418
uh there is no life this is why uh the

156
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:06,759
the people of Palestine have a right to

157
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,440
resist there is no life in Gaza um

158
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,160
Israel has made it their mission to make

159
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,000
sure that there is no life for the gazin

160
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,560
that are living in the Gaza Strip for 16

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,919
years the Israeli government has

162
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:25,000
suffocated Palestinians in Gaza under a

163
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:29,840
Draconian air sea and land military

164
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,440
blockade imprisoning and starving over 2

165
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,799.9999999999418
million people and denying them Medical

166
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,240
Aid so I think when we&#39;re thinking when

167
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,400.0000000000582
we&#39;re looking at a few days ago I think

168
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,280.0000000000582
it&#39;s really important to look at the

169
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,000
history of Palestine and contextualize

170
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,679.9999999999418
what&#39;s happening a lot of people want to

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,639
believe that this is a random moment

172
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,639
that happened on October 7th but

173
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,919
realistically speaking this is not true

174
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,680
this is a a building upon a military

175
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,039
occupation that has been happening for

176
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,960
75 plus years and Gaza specifically for

177
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,120
16 years Gazza has been under blackid

178
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,400
for 16 years no one can leave they&#39;ve

179
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,120
been denied the basic human rights of

180
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,120
just living a life along with having

181
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,759
food water fuel electricity and that&#39;s

182
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,919
what we&#39;re focusing on here today like I

183
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,280.0000000000582
said 16 years of Siege 16 years of being

184
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,039
held hostage in an open air prison where

185
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,758.9999999999418
you have been denied everything where

186
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,240
your family has been killed where you

187
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,680
have to hold your dying child and bury

188
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,879
them while you have to survive like we

189
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,120
have to look at the history ofans and

190
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,639
people in Palestine you&#39;ve had a series

191
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,240
of Wars uh 1948 was the most important

192
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,160
for our benefit that was when the state

193
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,879
of Israel was declared Arab armies

194
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,960.0000000000582
invaded uh and about 720,000 uh 720,000

195
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,80.00000000005821
Palestinians were forced to

196
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,520
flee um in the wake of that uh basically

197
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,520
the Palestinians called 1948 the

198
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,599
Israelis call it the war of independence

199
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,479
Palestinians call it the the nakba the

200
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:57,280
disaster you know and ever since then

201
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,280
the issue of Palestine has been on and

202
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,559.9999999999418
off the international agenda the

203
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,960
politicians are calling for a second

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
necka if you don&#39;t know what necka is it

205
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,680
means catastrophe it&#39;s what happened in

206
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,159
1948 when almost a million people were

207
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,120
displaced practically overnight and uh

208
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:11,599
genocide and massacres of over 250

209
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,039
Palestinian Villages and we&#39;re seeing

210
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,960
politicians not just from the Israeli

211
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,080
side but also the Us and other European

212
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,878.9999999999418
politicians calling for the leveling of

213
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,719.9999999999418
Gaza calling for a complete annihilation

214
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
of the Palestinian people do you think

215
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,280.0000000000582
like do you think the majority of people

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
in Gaza are against Hamas I would say

217
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
that that&#39;s not important I think what&#39;s

218
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,520.0000000000582
important here is condemning the

219
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,439.9999999999418
violence and the cuz I&#39;m Jewish right

220
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,559.9999999999418
and I&#39;m Israeli so I&#39;m very interested

221
00:08:32,440.0000000000582 --> 00:08:35,279.0000000001164
and I have friends that are Palestinian

222
00:08:33,559.9999999999418 --> 00:08:38,039
but somewhere in West Bank only one or

223
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,200.0000000000582
two friends from Gaza but a big concern

224
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,240
for us I would say is that people have

225
00:08:41,200.0000000000582 --> 00:08:44,640.0000000001164
no choice like if you wanted to speak

226
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,000
out against Kamas would it be

227
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,560
essentially safe for all your family

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,480
members still living

229
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,959
there I don&#39;t think you&#39;re asking the

230
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,839
right questions I&#39;m just saying it it&#39;s

231
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,640
a true question because not a lot of us

232
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,160.00000000011642
would have those rights in Gaza and

233
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,439.9999999998836
that&#39;s not because of Gaza it&#39;s not

234
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,880
because of the great Palestinian people

235
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,720
that make that place it&#39;s because of

236
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,279
hamama

237
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,959.0000000001164
Kamas is a terrorist organization that

238
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,959
runs that Palestinian people didn&#39;t do

239
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,000
it Kamas did and they&#39;ve radicalized

240
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,839
their whole spot and now the time has

241
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,600
come that there&#39;s a second holocaust,

242
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:15,360
1300 plus people were killed that would

243
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,560.0000000001164
be equal to over 35,000 Americans if

244
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,399
that was in America per capita could you

245
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,000
just say that is [ __ ] horrible where

246
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,200
was the international outcry when Israel

247
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,399
killed more than 200 Palestinians before

248
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,600
the recent events in 2023 do that I&#39;m

249
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,800
here to speak on behalf of my people so

250
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,839
that I mean if the caloa cartel sliced

251
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,479.9999999998836
up everyone in Texas and New Mexico what

252
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,160.00000000011642
do you think America would do based on

253
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,640
what you know America to be today plus

254
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,800
it&#39;s not just Jews Arabs Palestinian

255
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,760

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,959
