okay imagine on a first date instead of

you just nervous yapping yap yap yap

nervous yapping about yourself probably

imagine instead of that you had the

option to present your best qualities on

a PowerPoint presentation to the other

party well that&#39;s what this video is

today let&#39;s get into

[Applause]

[Music]

it hi I&#39;m Justine in a man I definitely

looking for someone who has a little bit

of confidence and definitely very

intelligent a PowerPoint is really going

to let me you should be looking for a

dude with good PowerPoint skills too I

feel like that&#39;s pretty essential not

only for this but just for real life how

often do you have a bunch of real good

info but you&#39;re like I need a I need a

fun way to present this that happens

pretty often in life sometimes it&#39;s good

to have a you know a partner that can

kind of show you the ropes see how these

guys think about themselves I hope to

see some I&#39;m not the best at PowerPoint

you know which sucks cuz I got a lot of

[ __ ] proprietary info up here you

know I&#39;d love to share it but they just

no elegant way to do so sometimes what

am I going to do speak it no that

wouldn&#39;t do it justice you know who can

have fun and make me

laugh I think we&#39;re going to start with

Antonio all right let&#39;s go

just making sure you got that so I put

together a uh uh presentation for you

decision oh I&#39;m down to earth and this

average statistic of 47.9% oh [ __ ]

opportunity to do the funniest thing

about me what if it was just about me

and then it&#39;s just like stats about

humans like I thought he was going to be

like I&#39;m 60% water as it turns out as

probably most of you in here are fun

fact about me my blood makes up about 8%

of my body

weight Isn&#39;t that cool next if you laid

my intestines out and to end they&#39;d be

about 4 miles

long European genetics uh from my

experience I have amass a total of 6t

years of growth of course she of course

circled I have a great relationship with

management my mom I like to code I&#39;m

proficient in many languages including

English and memes as I am an avid

consumer of them hi I&#39;m David and I&#39;m a

software developer for work but my real

passion is playing tennis let&#39;s go David

semi unprofessional okay okay I like

these dudes trying to be funny in here

it&#39;s like how do I show her I&#39;m like an

alpha but still like be you know kind of

[ __ ] self-deprecating about it you

know like I [ __ ] rock at tennis but

I&#39;m not that good you know I&#39;m semi

unprofessional I&#39;ll kick you your ass

though and most dude&#39;s asses especially

if they [ __ ] like you know try to

insult you or whatever like I&#39;ll come to

your defense but like and like a cool

way I play like pretty much every day

and I do some coaching on the side as

well um and I also really like traveling

so I travel a lot and I&#39;m always looking

for a new experiences and so a little

about me I originally am from she&#39;s just

writing shorta I grew up in Minnesota

and I lived there most of my life and I

also bring additional skills to the

table I can do an oil change or rotate

your tires or recharge your AC in your

car I like to hear that one and I

learned all that on YouTube cuz I&#39;m good

at following directions so here are a

few of my hobbies and interests I play a

lot of tennis and I&#39;m also like really

into the outdoors and you know music is

a really important part of my life so I

really like going to concerts or music

festivals and hopefully I could do some

of those things with

you that was that was wholesome as [ __ ]

man I kept waiting for a little bit of

meat for me to bite on to you know but

you got nothing I like music I like

concerts I&#39;m from Minnesota um I&#39;m good

at being I&#39;m good at taking orders um so

boss me around if you want um like

snowboarding and uh just really hope to

do those things with you so um I do like

the shirt color thank you just ain&#39;t

going to cap that&#39;s real nice um so I

work in sales but my biggest passions

are acting and music I do sometimes

impersonation sometimes so those are

really really fun um so you got to do

one you got you know what you&#39;re doing

when you say that you know what you&#39;re

doing throw one of your throw one of

your favorites at me we&#39;ll see if I can

do it um I love playing it that was an

invitation what are you doing that was

crowd interaction amazing I like this

guy although he should have been like

give me one who in the audience wants to

give me one you know instead he was like

he kind of assumed that she would do it

so maybe you know one day give me your

you know what someone you want me to do

impression of maybe maybe I got it

so okay next slide unless anyone has

anything to say no okay okay cool did I

hear Quinton Tarantino or no

right okay F cool next SL did I hear

Steve bshi somebody no okay next slide

let&#39;s go on next slide basketball I can

also cook a lot of food so mama had us

in the kitchen that&#39;s what happens when

you have a Caribbean mom so she always

made sure we were going to be able to

take care of those things how I would

describe myself I would say I&#39;m very

very easygoing I like to have a good

time I go with the flow of um [ __ ]

okay graphic designer damn all right

Johnny I this looks beautiful though

look at this people&#39;s personalities and

last but not not least looks like a

ransom note a little bit actually looks

a little threaten hey what it do

handsome you know what I&#39;m

saying all right hey everybody hi let&#39;s

all right

yakie let&#39;s go yakie I&#39;m rooting for you

dude I just like I like that he kind of

I don&#39;t know I feel like all the rest of

the guys kind of had like a sort of like

I don&#39;t know cool sort of like

alternative swag and then I feel like he

just came up like he

came like he came just straight from his

you know I don&#39;t know Finance job or

something like hi I&#39;m yakie cool I

actually did an Excel spreadsheet um

instead of a PowerPoint sorry I

misunderstood the the uh the the

instructions and I&#39;m just generally I&#39;m

just stronger with Excel you&#39;re probably

wondering who is he sure am ah and

there&#39;s a handsome boy my occupation I&#39;m

an actor comedian musician writer and

educator okay all right Miss sorry I

judge the book by its cover maybe it&#39;s

the sweater which is a cool sweater but

you know I don&#39;t know it&#39;s very sweatery

and I&#39;m frequently tired but good at

functioning as a tired person let&#39;s

start with the obvious things like most

people I like movies music books art and

good food I&#39;m really into comedy stuff

and I also like making music um and I

also like

cats bro are we the same

person oh my sparkling personality

here&#39;s some photos of me being sparkling

[Music]

wow who are you picking comment below

all right you know what [ __ ] it Joseph

comment so I put together some green

flag flag and red flags that I

personally look for okay I&#39;m looking for

someone that&#39;s reliable someone that has

a good relationship with their parents

and or siblings uh someone that&#39;s not

easily stressed someone who can kind of

keep it together red flags that I run

from uh someone that&#39;s always late it&#39;s

okay to be a little late I&#39;ll be on CPT

myself but not like not every every time

everywhere we go and then also if you

cheated in all of your relationships

kind of a red

flag in all of them 100% of them 85% I

I&#39;m cool with that you know I I can deal

with with that that&#39;s no problem I&#39;m I&#39;m

willing to be that 15% and then also no

relationship with parents what if she&#39;s

orphan dude everything that um I&#39;m a

pretty open person so I&#39;m looking for

someone who&#39;s not afraid to talk about

uh what they&#39;re feeling in that given

moment um and if they party more than

they work I think it&#39;s okay to party

hard but I think you should also work

hard as well and I think that&#39;s the end

of my

presentation this is a solid

presentation it was a solid presentation

you made you made a great case for

yourself and um I I&#39;d say you&#39;re in the

running also I created a graph to show

you uh what it would look like if you

spent time with me so as we can see fun

is directly correlated to time spent

with me down here less time more time

more fun I also added some visuals here

so you can enjoy and understand the

graphs a little bit better as we can see

emojis look at that emojis cuz I&#39;m a I&#39;m

not like the other guys all right I

don&#39;t just when I convey messages I like

to do with little pictures not just

boring words he went like the quirky

route you know which is working she&#39;s

laughing and I think that&#39;s probably

that&#39;s probably winning them some points

here laughter is definitely important

but it&#39;s some of this a little cheesy

and I added some emojis and then look

what the third layer is I added some

memes on top of that yeah you can pretty

much tell that a date with me is going

to be like the most fun thing in the

entire

world okay unless you don&#39;t want that

see you&#39;ll be crying non stop less time

always crying up there we have a heart

eyes a rocket ship and an infinity

symbol which means you&#39;ll have heart

eyes to infinity and beyond I like to

travel and then

like heart eyes to infinity and beyond

and then he clicks it again like an

eggplant and a squirt shows up and oops

oh [ __ ] um H man I put that in as a joke

I left that in though that&#39;s Fu uh a

picture over there is when I went to on

a solo trip to Korea um I like long

walks to the fridge I eat everything

I&#39;ve tried everything

once long walks to the fridge come on I

want to try everything once uh my mom

thinks I&#39;m at least a four out

10 uh it ain&#39;t much but it&#39;s honest work

one of the memes I enjoy green flag some

of the green and red flags that I

have or I can cook but I mainly cook

chicken I&#39;m a great listener but I also

she&#39;s cheesing look at that she is

cheesing she&#39;s loving him she&#39;s writing

down what is she writing little hearts

or around his name play too many video

games I&#39;m independent but I can&#39;t watch

any scary

movies I&#39;ve amassed a total amount of

2,000 to 2,000 hours in rocket League

pretty cool if I say so myself I can act

maybe leave that one off maybe leave

that one off bro predict any number

you&#39;re guessing between 1 and

20 is it


16 so

close anyways that&#39;s the end of my slide

thank you guys so much hope you enjoyed

personally not my favorite but who knows

she seemed to be enjoying it so I feel

like you&#39;re pretty you&#39;re pretty high up

there right now photo of uh me and two

my best friends just the

whome the most non-threatening guy ever

a picture of me and my best friends and

just hanging out and this is actually us

uh we were exploring a Cave System

actually right underneath one of the

dorms of my college

who holy [ __ ] and he&#39;s adventurous and

so green flags I look for in a partner

you know I really like uh girls that are

practical ambitious good sense of humor

is really important um adventurous like

willing to try new things I really look

for Good Chemistry so like if we can

talk and we just talk for hours and we

just never run out of things to talk

about um and also nice teeth because a

good smile I think really gets me and

you know red flags for me is like not

being what that always throws me off the

editing that editing is like the last

dude&#39;s presentation you know what I mean

being uncaring and that could be to me

or to others or being a picky eater cuz

I I really like trying new foods and so

here&#39;s what I bring to the table so I&#39;m

a hopeless romantic emphasis on hopeless

I&#39;m a good listener I&#39;ll always validate

your feelings and my arms are

disproportionately long so I give really

good hugs I just want to be you know one

of the couples that other people look at

and go that could be us David that&#39;s so

[Applause]

cute this is the nicest guy in the

entire world I think it might be I don&#39;t

I think this guy has a bad bone in his

body look at that all the dudes are like

I&#39;d [ __ ] date this guy wow let me

know if she doesn&#39;t work out

dude for me I&#39;ve only been in four

relationships but I would say for me

every single person that I have dated

they brought something to the table that

makes me who I am these are the flags we

going to talk about so green flags for

me I love when people are honest even if

it even if it hurts right like we should

tell the truth passionate loves sports

is creative has a good taste in movies

and music um you know down to earth and

is really competitive and then I would

say red flags for me are if you&#39;re just

super self-absorbed you don&#39;t have any

drive like you&#39;re not going for anything

um don&#39;t like to work out that green

flags my green flags are if they&#39;re

perfect and then my red flags are if

they&#39;re a murderer can&#39;t be a serial

killer no thank you I don&#39;t want any

part of that that&#39;s a red flag in my

book green flags Perfection if they&#39;re

perfect then I&#39;m down I love to work out

out um someone that&#39;s just very

judgmental that&#39;s not open to like

hearing people&#39;s stories and having

empathy and then someone that&#39;s just

like rude to people that&#39;s just not

really a Vibe for me just bringing

things who is looking for someone that

is rude to people who is looking for

that do people look for that I don&#39;t

think so oh my God I love when people

treat waiters like [ __ ] I love that

service people [ __ ] scum right I love

when people recognize that and treat

them as such so hot bringing things to a

wrap up why I think I&#39;m your guy is

because number one I&#39;m fun I&#39;m

intelligent I&#39;m a natural born leader

I&#39;m energetic sweet when I want to be

spicy when I have to be and encouraging

sweet when I want to be spicy when I

have to be that&#39;s a bar you know what

that spells

finesse sick so in case you saw that you

know what I&#39;m saying so here&#39;s the deal

with me without me with me without with

me without me with me without me

wow so this is the reasons why you

should pick me this song is actually

coming out so we can if you end up

coming on a date with me or whatever we

can listen to this together is this your

song

Yes wait

no no you you&#39;re killing it dude you

were killing it a man what a horrible

pitch so if you went on a dat we could

potentially listen to this song My

unreleased song together I could sit

there and watch you listen to it and

just like kind of read your face and you

have to like pretend like it&#39;s good

thoughts thank you very much appreciate

[Applause]

you that just shouldn&#39;t be like you just

like if there&#39;s not like social proof

that your music is good I mean I you

know I should be one to [ __ ] talk but

I make one [ __ ] thing and I&#39;m like

put it on on Soundcloud right away but

if there&#39;s no like social proof that

people really really enjoy your music

then this is like a fifth date thing you

know where you&#39;re like hey I just work

I&#39;ve been working on something could I

show you and just get your opinion it&#39;s

not like a and you might be the lucky

lady that gets to listen to this

unreleased song by me with me if you

play your cards right empathetic I&#39;m

patient and I&#39;m considerate I&#39;m a good

planner but I&#39;m also adaptable

spontaneous and go with the flow and I&#39;m

not the jealous type I&#39;m pretty secure

so that&#39;s I think a good selling point

we love a secure man we love

that uh I&#39;m also organized responsible

but I&#39;m also fun and sociable um and I

prioritize Mak

connections some of this I just lifted

from my nectar love

print the [ __ ] is that what the [ __ ] is

nectar love print I&#39;m emotionally

intelligent and fairly self-aware and uh

My Love Languages include physical touch

and quality time and also sometimes acts

of service depending on the relationship

Dynamic okay here&#39;s just some fun bonus

info uh here&#39;s me hanging out with

friends just being very normal and

fitting in um I&#39;m a bit of that guy

knows hanging out with friends he&#39;s like

did you not see the first picture of my

[ __ ] slideshow that was me hanging

out with my best friends by the way

exploring a Cave System underneath our

dorm a nerd and I&#39;m a big proponent of

therapy so I like therapy I feel like

it&#39;s good to be working on

ourselves uh I&#39;m Jewish uh and I live

alone I have no roommates which I feel

like is another huge selling point it is

thank you and then I&#39;ll just end boy I

really was paraphrasing my next

here so here&#39;s just a big block of text

and on a very flattering photo of myself

as a

baby so there we go that&#39;s

[Applause]

it not the strongest I would say I don&#39;t

think he made the strongest impression

he seems like a nice guy but just not

this you know I don&#39;t know questions

about some things you said have you ever

cheated in a relation do you want the

truth or you want a li I want the truth

you can&#39;t handle the truth

stop doing that uh I do not I&#39;ve cheated

in the past when I was younger and more

immature uh I think you can like grow

and mature as a person so I feel like

I&#39;ve done that I appreciate that Honesty

you said you can cook I can but I&#39;m

pescatarian so I don&#39;t eat any chicken

okay so then I&#39;m thinking we can have

some class did I say chicken a [ __ ] I&#39;m

meant chicken of the Seas

tuna uh quinoa oven baked salmon uh

maybe some either you know normal

vegetables as broccoli asparagus or

baked kale with some lemon zest on top

okay I&#39;ll take it you mentioned music

and I was interested what kind of music

you&#39;re into so I what&#39;s he going to say

what the [ __ ] is he going to say he&#39;s

going to say everything he&#39;s going to

say I like all music I&#39;m not genre

dependent or he&#39;s going to say like soft

Electronica listen to a lot of like

Indie Indie yeah that makes sense that

was my third guess um and so um I really

like glass animals um before they were

big really something that you said was

that you had your four relationships and

I want to know what you think they would

say about you I think that they would

definitely say that I&#39;m very attentive

that I&#39;m somebody that is always seeking

and striving to be better in

relationship to both of us as that&#39;s a

funny answer first of all I didn&#39;t even

think of that answer that&#39;s like that&#39;s

so like I think that they would say that

I I work I just work too damn hard you

know make too much money I think they

would they got frustrated just how much

how much attention I was paying to them

how much love I was showing them and how

much money I made and how much I cooked

for them I just that&#39;s what they said

you know what I actually wrote this song

about exactly that and let me play that

for you this one&#39;s unreleased as well

okay I like that do you do like standup

comedy improv like what do you into all

the above I&#39;ve done both for a number of

years yeah sick his presentation was

very like stand deppy wasn&#39;t it I&#39;m

actually Jewish um like everything had

that like sort of like Cadence and like

intonation is that the word I&#39;m caring

but uh I&#39;m also attentive so much thank

you you guys made this very hard uh I

wasn&#39;t expecting it to be so hard and

all right favorite right now um you know

I was liking Joseph&#39;s presentation but

the music thing just that that uh I

don&#39;t know that took him down a couple

pigs in my in my eyes I don&#39;t know why

you know so now I&#39;m kind of thinking

nice guy although Nice Guy&#39;s always

finished last so he&#39;s not going to win

we know that I&#39;m I&#39;m surprised by a lot

of these things but I think the person

that I&#39;m going to eliminate I&#39;m

eliminating them

because they said something that is

actually one of my red

flags and so unfortunately although I

love the honesty I&#39;m going to have to

eliminate

Antonio oh I mean we knew he was done

from the moment he said he&#39;s too short

to be a quarterback we knew he was done

that was it that was it he dug his own

grave there there God I&#39;m so sorry not

the

chair I don&#39;t necessarily think once a

cheater always a cheater but I don&#39;t

even want to put myself in that type of

position so it was just an immediate X

for me hi again I&#39;m Logan uh and this is

my idea of the perfect date oh we got

more presentation I thought they were

done okay first date ideas okay so short

and sweet I really like he&#39;s like okay

First Date Presentation here uh okay

first slide I think that would be great

just eggplant squirt Emoji oh [ __ ] why

do I [ __ ] sorry I ah sorry mini golf

I think this would be the absolute

perfect date it&#39;s really relaxed and

stressfree it&#39;s also a lot of time to

talk so it&#39;s a great time where I can

get to know you we can talk about things

that we are interested in you know get

to know each other while we&#39;re putting

through the green I can&#39;t name a single

mini golf place in La do they exist here

I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t think so I think

Mini golf dates just happen in movies I

don&#39;t think people actually do that do

they let me know am I just like in the

little La bubble or something added a

fun little animation of what it would

look like if we play mini

golf it was a little frowny face cuz you

missed do I like mini golf oh

no this is a preview of what it looked

like to have dinner with oh my God

sweetheart look at this look at this

[ __ ] meal too do you think you made

all this probably and you said you&#39;re

pescatarian mhm uh do you like sushi I

love love that&#39;s great cuz I am obsessed

and I really like trying new things so I

was thinking that we could and I found a

some interesting Sushi making classes in

downtown and I was thinking we could go

to a class together and we could learn

to make sushi just get to learn to make

succulent sushi rice you really had to

put succulent in there dude you couldn&#39;t

have thought of any other word but

succulent in your presentation just get

to feel each other out a little bit also

dinner&#39;s built in so we can eat we can

eat what we made afterwards amazing um

after that we could take a drive out to

to Santa Monica Pier at night and we

could you know watch the sunset over the

beach I don&#39;t know about that you got

all of LA to do stuff and you&#39;re going

to pick the most the number one most

touristy thing in LA to do I don&#39;t know

about that I think the waves are

actually better when you&#39;re watching

them at night cuz it really feels like

you&#39;re in a movie and if there&#39;s one

thing that I try to do is I try to live

my life like I&#39;m in a future

film holy

[ __ ] wait what the [ __ ] did he just drop

my life as a movie at the end of oh my

god dude that was so out of character

for that that was so out of character

for him and if there&#39;s one thing that I

try to do is I try to live my life like

I&#39;m in a future

film D my friends and I always say that

[ __ ] Ah that&#39;s so funny people always

say my life a movie last night was a

movie so like I feel like it&#39;s funny to

try and find like different forms of

that you know I mean this isn&#39;t [ __ ]

new if it&#39;s one thing I try to do is try

to live my life like I&#39;m in a feature

film that&#39;s some sauce right there dude

and if it&#39;s one thing I try to do

is I try to live like I&#39;m in a clation

movie so so here we have um a kitchen so

what I did with this whole picture is is

like a kind of variety of different

experiences right so you can do an at

home type of a date situation I love to

cook and you said you&#39;re a prescatarian

so one of my favorite dishes to make is

like a salmon pasta dish but in my head

I&#39;m thinking wait a minute we could do

this together so it&#39; be a process where

we&#39;re working together almost a little

competition but a whole lot a character

and then we get to try the the outcome I

know it&#39;s delicious but you know you&#39;re

going to have to find out um I&#39;m a

really really big fan of going to comedy

shows like comedy shows are really

really great because you know we can

both sit there I love the guy&#39;s

reactions they&#39;re like H [ __ ] [ __ ] I

should have said that [ __ ] we can laugh

um and then and then finally as the

final Act you&#39;re going to watch me

perform my brand new unreleased song

after something is over just go and and

sit down somewhere really really nice or

go for a walk head to the beach over

here all right I would like to go on

David&#39;s date so if you if you could take

me that would be great um but in Li of

that here&#39;s another option this is

called this could be for you wow uh and

I went with a weird theme which is uh

stuff stuff based around Vermont Avenue

um I don&#39;t know why but I thought uh and

you know remember nothing set in stone

here thank you uh location one Griffith

Park Vermont entrance keepy it on theme

activity a little hike and then walk

around the observatory and admire the

view possibly at Sunset if I time it

right H look at that breathtaking so

here&#39;s some options a uh right down the

street is lots of cool artsy bookstores

and music shops and other like vintage

stores um or if you go a little further

down the street there&#39;s a family arcade

which is I think fun and a little

different oh yeah arcade now we&#39;re

talking little dve Busters ideal date

that&#39;s perfect or somebody already said

this but if you go even further down

Vermont Avenue oh my gosh there&#39;s

bowling uh and then finally because at

this point I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve worked up a

big appetite we should have dinner and

there&#39;s so many good neighborhoods right

there that have delicious food and this

is pictures of food I also like sushi

and tacos and burgers and ramen and all

kinds of stuff and we&#39;ll be we&#39;ll be so

hungry at that point so that&#39;s it I

really loved all of these pitches they

were all great and those were great but

I mean I feel like I feel like they were

just trying to describe like an ideal

date we can make food together or we

take Sushi classes you know I wish one

dude was like you know we&#39;re going to

[ __ ] get hammered probably yeah

probably take you to a rave just

something to that&#39;s like just doesn&#39;t

fit at all in this Warehouse Rave had an

element about it that I would like

whether that&#39;s like having some time to

talk with one another or the actual

activity that we&#39;re doing I think I&#39;m

going to have to eliminate this person

because like I said I just don&#39;t know

about she&#39;s getting rid of uh white boy

sweating on a first date if it&#39;s really

hot and doing a big hike so I&#39;m so sorry

but I&#39;m going to have to eliminate Yaky

that&#39;s okay thank you later Yaky nice

work dude nice work you did the best you

could he did a great job he did a great

job he&#39;s a Charming guy

you I don&#39;t know if we should have

clapped for that I think that a girl

that would be really good for him she&#39;s

going to be a little bit quirkier than I

am you know I want him to have the best

and I just don&#39;t think for him it&#39;s me

okay so when I first got here I was

really nervous and when you guys were

doing your presentations and opening up

to me who&#39;s she going to pick you think

it&#39;s going to be the meme guy it&#39;s not

going to be the nice guy because nice

guys come last even though his life is

literally a feature film even though

every day in his life is like the

premiere of a Hollywood movie yeah my

life is kind of a Marvel movie um I

think it might be Joseph made me feel

really open and really receptive and one

of you guys I feel like I just loved

their energy and their Vibe and their

authenticity and I want to pick this

person because I feel like I have a lot

of things in common with them and I

don&#39;t know I think that they&#39;re really

great and they&#39;re cute and they seem fun

so I&#39;m going to pick

David uh

what what all right maybe his [ __ ]

life is a movie damn that&#39;s a movie

thing that just happened that would

happen in a [ __ ] movie and it just

happened so maybe my my boy&#39;s life is a

freaking indie film perhaps uh or in

this case a romcom

damn thank you thank you they just start

making out it&#39;s like whoa this dude&#39;s

life is a [ __ ]

movie oh

yeah don&#39;t forget your

chairs I&#39;m really excited for hopefully

our Sushi date that comes to fruition I

really like the how you have things in

common with me I I didn&#39;t really list

that many uh things I like how you have

things in common with me

Riz RZ about me so I&#39;m really glad that

some of those things we already have in

common well I think like the fact that

you&#39;re hopeless romantic I I think that

that really speaks to me like I like

someone who&#39;s going to be like soft and

like affectionate and kind and sweet she

just calls you soft he&#39;s like all right

should we go suck down some succul and

Sushi or what&#39;s up oh that was fun that

was a great [ __ ] video I had a blast
