1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,910
in this segment we start a discussion of

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,289.9999999999991
multiple continuous random variables

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:11,010
here are some objects that were already

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:14,280.0000000000018
familiar with but exactly as in the

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,130
discrete case if we are dealing with two

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,119
random variables it is not enough to

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,130
know their individual PDFs we also need

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,960
to model the relation between the two

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,198.99999999999636
random variables and this is done

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,969
through a joint PDF which is the

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,880
continuous analogue of the joint PMF we

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,930
will use this notation to indicate joint

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,090
PDFs where we use F to indicate that we

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,370
are dealing with a density so what

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,030
remains to be done is to actually define

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,449
this object and see how we use it let us

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,940
start by recalling that joint pmfs were

18
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,129
defined in terms of the probability that

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,579
the pair of random variables x and y

20
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:03,239
takes certain specific values little X

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,610
and little Y regarding joint PDFs we

22
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,380
start by saying that it has to be

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,549
non-negative however a more precise

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,729
interpretation in terms of probabilities

25
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,799
has to wait a little bit

26
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:20,400
joint PDFs will be used to calculate

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,009
probabilities and this will be done in

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,140
analogy with the discrete setting in the

29
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,880
discrete setting the probability that

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,479
the pair of random variables falls

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,119
inside a certain set is just the sum of

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,679.9999999999854
the probabilities of all the possible

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,990
pairs inside that particular set for the

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,049
continuous case we introduce an

35
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,899
analogous formula we use the joint

36
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,659
density instead of the joint PMF and

37
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,950
instead of having a summation we now

38
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:58,770.0000000000146
integrate as in the discrete setting we

39
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:02,729
have one total unit of probability the

40
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,390
joint PDF tells us how this unit of

41
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,848.9999999999854
probability is spread over the entire

42
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:12,629
continuous two-dimensional plane and we

43
00:02:08,848.9999999999854 --> 00:02:13,339.9999999999709
use it we use the joint PDF to calculate

44
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,359.9999999999709
the

45
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:21,769
ability of a certain set by finding the

46
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:25,190.0000000000291
volume under the joint PDF that lies on

47
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:28,340
top of that set this is what this

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,129
integral really represents we integrate

49
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:36,650
over a particular 2-dimensional set and

50
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:39,470
we take this value that we integrate and

51
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,519
we can think of this as the height of an

52
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:46,040
object that&#39;s sitting on top of that set

53
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,500
now this relation here this calculation

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,459
of probabilities is not something that

55
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:56,090
we are supposed to prove this is rather

56
00:02:52,459 --> 00:03:00,290
the definition of what a joint PDF does

57
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,780
a legitimate joint PDF is any function

58
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:07,879
of two variables which is non-negative

59
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:10,420
and which integrates to 1 and we will

60
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:14,989
say that two random variables are

61
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:19,100
jointly continuous if there is a

62
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:21,470
legitimate joint PDF that can be used to

63
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,130
calculate the Associated probabilities

64
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,590
through this particular formula so we

65
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,650
have really an indirect definition

66
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,650
instead of defining the joint PDF as a

67
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,519
probability we actually define it

68
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,700.0000000000291
indirectly by saying what it does how it

69
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,169
will be used to calculate probabilities

70
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:48,888.9999999999709
a picture will be helpful here here is a

71
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:54,109
plot of a possible joint PDF these are

72
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:58,849.0000000000291
the X and y axes and the faction being

73
00:03:54,109 --> 00:04:02,750
plotted is the joint PDF of these two

74
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:05,599
random variables this joint PDF is

75
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,760
higher at some places and lower at

76
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,250
others indicating that certain regions

77
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,160
of the XY plane are more likely than

78
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,579
others the joint PDF determines the

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:21,219
probability of a set B by integrating

80
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:24,729
over that set B let&#39;s say it&#39;s this set

81
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:27,030
integrating the PDF over that set

82
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:31,260
pictorially what this means

83
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:35,820
is that we look at the volume that sits

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:39,900
on top of that set but below the PDF

85
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:42,090
below the joint PDF and so we obtain

86
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,299.9999999999418
some three-dimensional objects of this

87
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:49,770
kind and this integral corresponds to

88
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,710.0000000000582
actually finding this volume here the

89
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:57,020
volume that sits on top of the set B but

90
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,020
which is below the joint PDF

91
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:04,289.9999999999418
let us now develop some additional

92
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:09,390
understanding of joint PDFs as we just

93
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:14,970
discussed for any given set B we can

94
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:18,599.9999999999418
integrate the joint PDF over that set

95
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,750
and this will give us the probability of

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,580.0000000000582
that particular set of particular

97
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,970
interest is the case where we are

98
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:29,729
dealing with a set which is a rectangle

99
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,160
in which case the situation is a little

100
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,770
simpler so suppose that we have a

101
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,400.0000000000582
rectangle where the x-coordinate ranges

102
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:42,630
from a to b and the y-coordinate ranges

103
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,500
from some c to some d then the double

104
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,240
integral over this particular rectangle

105
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,240
can be written in the form where we

106
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,660
first integrate with respect one of the

107
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,390
variables that ranges from A to B and

108
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:01,430
then we integrate over all possible

109
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:04,200
values of y as they range from C to D a

110
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,830
particular interest is the special case

111
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:11,130
where we&#39;re dealing with a small

112
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:14,430
rectangle such as this one a rectangle

113
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:20,250
with sizes equal to some Delta where

114
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,979
Delta is a small number in that case the

115
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:27,090
double integral which is the volume on

116
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:32,070
top of that rectangle is simpler to

117
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:34,619.9999999999418
evaluate it is equal to the value of the

118
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,810
function that we are integrating at some

119
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,210
point in the rectangle let&#39;s take that

120
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,850
corner times the area of the

121
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:46,060
little rectangle which is equal to Delta

122
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,460.0000000000582
square so we have an interpretation of

123
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,750
the joint PDF in terms of probabilities

124
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:55,318.9999999999418
of small rectangles joint PDFs are not

125
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,569
probabilities but rather they are

126
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:03,610
probability densities they tell us the

127
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:06,069
probability per unit area and one more

128
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,440
important comment for the case of a

129
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:11,110
single continuous random variable we

130
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,500
know that any single point has zero

131
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,810
probability this is a game true for the

132
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,050
case of two jointly continuous random

133
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:25,479
variables but more is true if you take a

134
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:28,389
set B that has zero area for example a

135
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:34,620
certain curve suppose that this curve is

136
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:38,380
the entire set B then the volume under

137
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:42,810
the joint PDF that&#39;s sitting on top of

138
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:47,560
that curve is going to be equal to zero

139
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:50,199
so zero area sets have zero probability

140
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,419
and this is one of the characteristic

141
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,840.0000000000582
features of jointly continuous random

142
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:59,349
variables now let&#39;s think of a

143
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,820
particular situation suppose that X is a

144
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:05,860
continuous random variable and let Y be

145
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,070
another random variable which is

146
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,560
identically equal to X since X is a

147
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,289
continuous random variable Y is also a

148
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,050
continuous random variable however in

149
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,180
this situation we are certain that the

150
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:23,110
outcome of the experiment is going to

151
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,750
fall on the line where x equals y all

152
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:30,880
the probability lies on top of a line

153
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:33,669
and a line has zero area so we have

154
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,309.9999999999418
positive probability on a set of zero

155
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,819.9999999999418
area which contradicts what we discussed

156
00:08:36,309.9999999999418 --> 00:08:39,728.9999999999418
before

157
00:08:36,820.0000000000582 --> 00:08:42,940.0000000000582
well this simply means that x and y are

158
00:08:39,729.0000000000582 --> 00:08:45,130
not jointly continuous each one of them

159
00:08:42,940.0000000000582 --> 00:08:48,880.0000000001164
is continuous but together they&#39;re not

160
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:51,720
jointly continuous essentially joint

161
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,889
continuity is something more than

162
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,889
requiring each random very

163
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:59,920
to be continued by itself for joint

164
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:03,509
continuity we want the probability to be

165
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,339
really spread over two dimensions

166
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:09,249
probability is not allowed to be

167
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:10,869
concentrated on a one-dimensional set on

168
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,910
the other hand in this example the

169
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:15,489
probability is concentrated on a

170
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,660
one-dimensional set and we do not have

171
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,660.0000000001164
joint continuity
