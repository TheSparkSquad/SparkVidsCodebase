dude with good PowerPoint skills too I

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,840
feel like that&#39;s pretty essential not

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,640
only for this but just for real life how

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,280
often do you have a bunch of real good

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
info but you&#39;re like I need a I need a

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,559
fun way to present this that happens

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,280
pretty often in life sometimes it&#39;s good

23
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,78.99999999999272
to have a you know a partner that can

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,920
kind of show you the ropes see how these

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,719
guys think about themselves I hope to

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,280
no elegant way to do so sometimes what

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,120
comment so I put together some green

247
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,680
flag flag and red flags that I

248
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,959.0000000001164
personally look for okay I&#39;m looking for

249
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,279
someone that&#39;s reliable someone that has

250
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,079
a good relationship with their parents

251
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,680
and or siblings uh someone that&#39;s not

252
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,439.9999999998836
easily stressed someone who can kind of

253
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,560
keep it together red flags that I run

254
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,600
from uh someone that&#39;s always late it&#39;s

255
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,279
okay to be a little late I&#39;ll be on CPT

256
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,79.00000000011642
myself but not like not every every time

257
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,079
everywhere we go and then also if you

258
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,239.99999999988358
cheated in all of your relationships

259
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,920
kind of a red

260
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,000
flag in all of them 100% of them 85% I

261
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,959
I&#39;m cool with that you know I I can deal

262
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,480
with with that that&#39;s no problem I&#39;m I&#39;m

263
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,079
willing to be that 15% and then also no

264
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,640
relationship with parents what if she&#39;s

265
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,399
orphan dude everything that um I&#39;m a

266
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,720
pretty open person so I&#39;m looking for

267
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,240
someone who&#39;s not afraid to talk about

268
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,240
uh what they&#39;re feeling in that given

269
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,800
moment um and if they party more than

270
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,959.0000000001164
they work I think it&#39;s okay to party

271
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,319.9999999998836
hard but I think you should also work

272
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,560
hard as well and I think that&#39;s the end

273
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,279
of my

274
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,439.9999999998836
presentation this is a solid

275
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,640
presentation it was a solid presentation

276
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,640.0000000001164
you made you made a great case for

277
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,240
yourself and um I I&#39;d say you&#39;re in the

278
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,640
running also I created a graph to show

279
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,560.0000000001164
you uh what it would look like if you

280
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,680
spent time with me so as we can see fun

281
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,599.9999999998836
is directly correlated to time spent

282
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:17,319.9999999998836
with me down here less time more time

283
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,360
more fun I also added some visuals here

284
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,600
so you can enjoy and understand the

285
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,920
graphs a little bit better as we can see

286
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,560.0000000001164
emojis look at that emojis cuz I&#39;m a I&#39;m

287
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,399
not like the other guys all right I

288
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,040
don&#39;t just when I convey messages I like

289
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,160
to do with little pictures not just

290
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,399
boring words he went like the quirky

291
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,360
route you know which is working she&#39;s

292
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,760
laughing and I think that&#39;s probably

293
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,639
that&#39;s probably winning them some points

294
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,560
here laughter is definitely important

295
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,519
but it&#39;s some of this a little cheesy

296
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,439.9999999998836
and I added some emojis and then look

297
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,120
what the third layer is I added some

298
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,560.0000000001164
memes on top of that yeah you can pretty

299
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,880
much tell that a date with me is going

300
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,160
to be like the most fun thing in the

301
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,760
entire

302
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,240
world okay unless you don&#39;t want that

303
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,160
see you&#39;ll be crying non stop less time

304
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,160
always crying up there we have a heart

305
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,519
eyes a rocket ship and an infinity

306
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,519
symbol which means you&#39;ll have heart

307
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,279
eyes to infinity and beyond I like to

308
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,360
travel and then

309
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,560
like heart eyes to infinity and beyond

310
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,880
and then he clicks it again like an

311
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,000
eggplant and a squirt shows up and oops

312
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,839
oh [ __ ] um H man I put that in as a joke

313
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,480
I left that in though that&#39;s Fu uh a

314
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,839
picture over there is when I went to on

315
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
a solo trip to Korea um I like long

316
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,880.0000000001164

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,760
once long walks to the fridge come on I

319
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,119.99999999988358

10 uh it ain&#39;t much but it&#39;s honest work

322
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,720
one of the memes I enjoy green flag some

323
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,720

324
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,040

every single person that I have dated

390
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,40.000000000116415
they brought something to the table that

391
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,040
makes me who I am these are the flags we

392
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,360

399
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,79.00000000011642
say red flags for me are if you&#39;re just

400
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,600
super self-absorbed you don&#39;t have any

401

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,40.000000000116415
hearing people&#39;s stories and having

413
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,599.9999999998836
empathy and then someone that&#39;s just

502
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,240
really was paraphrasing my next

503
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,159
here so here&#39;s just a big block of text

504
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,679
and on a very flattering photo of myself

505
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:39,340.00000000023283
as a

506
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:42,120.00000000023283
baby so there we go that&#39;s

507
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,080
[Applause]

508
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,600
it not the strongest I would say I don&#39;t

509
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,000
think he made the strongest impression

510
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,678.9999999997672
he seems like a nice guy but just not

511
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,480
this you know I don&#39;t know questions

512
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,760
about some things you said have you ever

513
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,120.00000000023283
cheated in a relation do you want the

514
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,200
truth or you want a li I want the truth

515
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,678.9999999997672
you can&#39;t handle the truth

516
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,400
stop doing that uh I do not I&#39;ve cheated

517
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,000
in the past when I was younger and more

518
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,200
immature uh I think you can like grow

519
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,080
and mature as a person so I feel like

520
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,760
I&#39;ve done that I appreciate that Honesty

521
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,080
you said you can cook I can but I&#39;m

522
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,120
pescatarian so I don&#39;t eat any chicken

523
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,120
okay so then I&#39;m thinking we can have

524
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,439.99999999976717
some class did I say chicken a [ __ ] I&#39;m

525
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,439.99999999976717
meant chicken of the Seas

526
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,600
tuna uh quinoa oven baked salmon uh

527
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,000
maybe some either you know normal

528
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,799
vegetables as broccoli asparagus or

529
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,720
baked kale with some lemon zest on top

530
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,559
okay I&#39;ll take it you mentioned music

531
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,799
and I was interested what kind of music

532
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,080
you&#39;re into so I what&#39;s he going to say

533
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,120
what the [ __ ] is he going to say he&#39;s

534
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,158.99999999976717
going to say everything he&#39;s going to

535
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,879.9999999997672
say I like all music I&#39;m not genre

536
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,640
dependent or he&#39;s going to say like soft

537
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,280.00000000023283
Electronica listen to a lot of like

538
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,600.0000000002328
Indie Indie yeah that makes sense that

539
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,678.9999999997672
was my third guess um and so um I really

540
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,399.99999999976717
like glass animals um before they were

541
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,919
big really something that you said was

542
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,600.0000000002328
that you had your four relationships and

543
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,880
I want to know what you think they would

544
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,840
say about you I think that they would

545
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,760.0000000002328
definitely say that I&#39;m very attentive

546
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,240
that I&#39;m somebody that is always seeking

547
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,720
and striving to be better in

548
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,000
relationship to both of us as that&#39;s a

549
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,679
funny answer first of all I didn&#39;t even

550
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,720
think of that answer that&#39;s like that&#39;s

551
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,240
so like I think that they would say that

552
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,200
I I work I just work too damn hard you

553
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,640
know make too much money I think they

554
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,120.00000000023283
would they got frustrated just how much

555
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,80.00000000023283
how much attention I was paying to them

556
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,959.9999999997672
how much love I was showing them and how

557
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,120
much money I made and how much I cooked

558
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,679
for them I just that&#39;s what they said

559
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,239.99999999976717
you know what I actually wrote this song

560
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,159
about exactly that and let me play that

561
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,159
for you this one&#39;s unreleased as well

565
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,080
years yeah sick his presentation was

566
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,760
very like stand deppy wasn&#39;t it I&#39;m

567
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,199.99999999976717
actually Jewish um like everything had

568
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,158.99999999976717
that like sort of like Cadence and like

569
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,120.00000000023283
intonation is that the word I&#39;m caring

570
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,39.00000000023283
but uh I&#39;m also attentive so much thank

571
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,439.99999999976717
you you guys made this very hard uh I

572
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:16,039
wasn&#39;t expecting it to be so hard and

573
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,039
all right favorite right now um you know

574
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:20,320
I was liking Joseph&#39;s presentation but

575
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,440
the music thing just that that uh I

576
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,320
don&#39;t know that took him down a couple

577
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,840.0000000002328
pigs in my in my eyes I don&#39;t know why

578
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,360
you know so now I&#39;m kind of thinking

579
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,240
nice guy although Nice Guy&#39;s always

580
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,320
finished last so he&#39;s not going to win

581
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,720
we know that I&#39;m I&#39;m surprised by a lot

582
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,158.99999999976717
of these things but I think the person

583
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
that I&#39;m going to eliminate I&#39;m

584
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,279
eliminating them

585
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,640
because they said something that is

586
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,720
actually one of my red

587
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,559.0000000002328
flags and so unfortunately although I

588
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,919
love the honesty I&#39;m going to have to

589
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,080
eliminate

590
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,600.0000000002328
Antonio oh I mean we knew he was done

591
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,760
from the moment he said he&#39;s too short

592
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,600
to be a quarterback we knew he was done

593
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,080
that was it that was it he dug his own

594
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,240
grave there there God I&#39;m so sorry not

595
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,240
the

596
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,200
chair I don&#39;t necessarily think once a

597
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,919
cheater always a cheater but I don&#39;t

598
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,760
even want to put myself in that type of

599
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:17,240
position so it was just an immediate X

600
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,200

601
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,919

610
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,600
perfect date it&#39;s really relaxed and

611
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,000
stressfree it&#39;s also a lot of time to

612
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,840

613
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,159

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,120
Mini golf dates just happen in movies I

620
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,840

fun little animation of what it would

624
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,880

to Santa Monica Pier at night and we

672
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,200
try and find like different forms of

673
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,880
that you know I mean this isn&#39;t [ __ ]

674
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,159
new if it&#39;s one thing I try to do is try

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,399
to live my life like I&#39;m in a feature

676
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,440
film that&#39;s some sauce right there dude

677
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:00,639.9999999997672
and if it&#39;s one thing I try to do

678
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:06,000
is I try to live like I&#39;m in a clation

679
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,320.00000000023283
movie so so here we have um a kitchen so

680
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,480
what I did with this whole picture is is

681
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,799
like a kind of variety of different

682
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,000
experiences right so you can do an at

683
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,960
home type of a date situation I love to

684
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,159
cook and you said you&#39;re a prescatarian

685
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,480
so one of my favorite dishes to make is

686
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,520.0000000002328
like a salmon pasta dish but in my head

687
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,799
I&#39;m thinking wait a minute we could do

688
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,279
this together so it&#39; be a process where

689
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,639.9999999997672
we&#39;re working together almost a little

690
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:30,600
competition but a whole lot a character

691
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,720
and then we get to try the the outcome I

692
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,799
know it&#39;s delicious but you know you&#39;re

693
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,799
going to have to find out um I&#39;m a

694
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,799
really really big fan of going to comedy

695
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,639.9999999997672
shows like comedy shows are really

696
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:41,320
really great because you know we can

697
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,840.0000000002328
both sit there I love the guy&#39;s

698
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,879.9999999997672

699
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,199.99999999976717
should have said that [ __ ] we can laugh

700
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,840.0000000002328
um and then and then finally as the

701
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,039
final Act you&#39;re going to watch me

702
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,799

703
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:55,960
after something is over just go and and

704
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,639.9999999997672
sit down somewhere really really nice or

705
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,200

down the street there&#39;s a family arcade

726
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,520

big appetite we should have dinner and

735

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,879.9999999997672
were all great and those were great but

743
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,000
I mean I feel like I feel like they were

744
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,159
just trying to describe like an ideal

745
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,679

activity that we&#39;re doing I think I&#39;m

756
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,399
going to have to eliminate this person

757
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,919
because like I said I just don&#39;t know

758
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:11,000
about she&#39;s getting rid of uh white boy

759
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,799.0000000002328

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,519
