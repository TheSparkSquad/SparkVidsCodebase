hi welcome to another episode of Cold

Fusion France deleted the iPhone 12 from

sale due to high radiation levels this

raises some concerns if a phone is

released on the market shouldn&#39;t there

be a myriad of checks and balances to

make sure it&#39;s safe before it hits the

shelves have you ever wondered if your

smartphone could be harming your health

smartphones emit radiation right and

doesn&#39;t radiation cause cancer these

types of questions come from common

confusion behind the types of radiation

and their effects on the human body in

this episode we&#39;ll look at how to think

about radiation how much radiation your

phone emits if it&#39;s dangerous and why

the iPhone 12 got

banned you are watching C Fusion

TV

first up what is radiation well

radiation is just a type of energy that

travels from one point to another either

as waves or

particles fun fact bananas produce

radiation so does air and even your body

in fact anything made of atoms produces

a little bit of radiation when some

unstable atoms within a given material

Decay this is called particle radiation

but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about

here the kind of radiation we&#39;re talking

about in this episode is electrom

magnetic

radiation the sun emits this kind of

radiation your smartphone does and even

Wi-Fi so how much radiation does your

phone emit we can express the radiation

that lands on your body in watts per

kilogram this measures how energy is

absorbed by body tissue when exposed to

low levels of radiation the

internationally recognized safe limit

for mobile phones is 4 watts per kilog

so it goes that your phone would have

less than that amount but this is

meaningless without context is this

amount dangerous even if not it couldn&#39;t

be a good thing to have any radiation

close to our ears or near our brains

well to answer this let&#39;s first take a

look at the kind of radiation our phones

are

emitting phones emit radiation in the

radio frequency region of the

electromagnetic spectrum the higher the

frequency the higher the energy most

phones emit radio waves in the frequency

range of 1 to 3 GHz radios televisions

radar satellites micro wave ovens

computers and wireless networks use

frequencies in the same vicinity these

waves have less energy than visible

light this level of radiation is called

nonionizing that just means that these

waves don&#39;t have enough energy to strip

off electrons and cause DNA damage and

cancer but something happens when you

increase the frequency of these waves

beyond the frequency of visible light

Things become

dangerous evv light has energy just

above visual light and it damages our

skin via the sun levels at these

energies and above are called ionizing

radiation x-rays cosmic rays and gamma

rays from radioactive material fall

under this category it damages DNA ruins

genes and increases the risk of cancer

these are the waves to watch out for as

aside it&#39;s always cool to think that

x-rays Bluetooth and visible light are

the same thing just with different

wavelengths but some Keen eyed among you

would look at this diagram and say wait

a minute if microwaves can cook my food

and it has a similar wavelength as my

phone how is it that our brains aren&#39;t

getting cooked well amongst other

factors it&#39;s mainly about the power

level a microwave can blast out

electromagnetic waves with a figurative

force of 1,200 W of power a phone on the

other hand is in the range of M with

that being said all of us use mobile

phones so if there&#39;s any danger at all

we need to get to the bottom of this has

there been any increases in cancer that

coincides with the use of mobile phones

what if there&#39;s some mysterious

radiation phenomena that affects humans

a phenomena that exists in the exact

conditions of using a mobile phone is

there some scientific evidence to

suggest that well surprisingly the

answer isn&#39;t a conclusive no let&#39;s take

a look we&#39;ll get to the surprising

research on smartphone radiation soon

but first a quick word from our sponsor

brilliant if some of the scientific

elements of this episode seem a bit

complicated there&#39;s now a fun and easy

way to learn more about them for

instance when I was doing videos on AI

continue so the bad news first a small

handful of Studies have shown that cell

phones and brain tumors are

statistically correlated for example a

Swedish study reported statistically

significant trends of increasing brain

cancer risk for people who begun using

mobile phones before the age of 20 the

risk was proportional to the number of

years and the amount of cell phones

usage but before you panic most other

studies indicate the opposite they state

that there&#39;s no link between mobile

phone use and rates of cancer another

study from Sweden showed no increase in

brain cancer among long-term cell phone

use between the ages of 20 and 69 an

international study of children

diagnosed with brain cancer between the

ages of 7 and 19 found no relationship

between their Mobile use and an

increased risk of brain cancer but for

more detail we should look into the

largest control study ever done on the

topic researchers from 13 countries

analyze questionnaires from participants

in Europe Israel Canada Australia New

Zealand and Japan the purpose was to

determine the risk of head and neck

tumors from mobile phone use the results

have been analyzed by the National

Cancer Institute in the US and they&#39;ve

laid out their findings as follows most

published analyses of the study show no

overall increases in brain or other

central nervous system cancers related

to higher amounts of mobile phone use

one analysis showed a statistically

significant although small increase in

the risk of brain tumors among study

participants who spent the most total

time on their phones although the

researchers state that due to a variety

of reasons this finding is

inconclusive another analysis of the

data of all 13 countries reported a

statistically significant association

between the distribution of interc

cranial tumors within the brain and the

self-reported location of the phone

however the authors of these studies

also say that these findings are

inconclusive and firm conclusions can&#39;t

be drawn another study of five northern

European countries showed an increase of

non-cancerous brain tumors in those who

have used a cell phone for 10 or more

years so what on Earth is going on here

why are the findings so inconsistent as

it turns out studying the physiological

effects of mobile radiation in humans is

hard there are so many ways that the

data could be muddied and skewed for

example

participants could mistakenly say that

they used their phone more or less than

they actually did during a given time

period it&#39;s just hard to accurately

recall aside from that this

participation bias people who are

diagnosed with brain tumors are more

likely than healthy people to enroll in

a research study some other factors that

can account for inconsistencies can

include the assumptions used to estimate

doses failure to consider temperature

effects and investigators not being

blinded to exposure status so even

though we don&#39;t have a definitive answer

on the risks of mobile phone use the

culmination of these studies point to

minimal effects if any and if it means

anything to you the FDA CDC and FCC all

say that there&#39;s no scientific evidence

that phones cause cancer and that

current regulations are safe quote based

on our ongoing evaluation of the issue

we have not found adverse health effects

in hum we believe the current safety

limits for cell phones are acceptable

for protecting the public health end

quote in any case it&#39;s probably a good

thing that we don&#39;t put our phones up to

our ears as much as we used

[Music]

to so in all of this there&#39;s one

remaining question why did France ban

the iPhone 12 for emitting too much

radiation there must have been some

glitch that caused the phones to blast

out electromagnetic waves at microwave

oven power levels right well not quite

remember how the highest safe radiation

limit for mobile phones was 4 wats per

kg the iPhone 12 managed to score 5.74 W

per kgam as University of wenong

Professor Rodney crof says a radiation

reading of 5.74 wats per kgam is many

times below what would be required to

cause any harm it is important to note

that this will not have any impact on

health to put the exposure level into

context 5.7 watts per kog would only

cause a temperature rise in limbs of

less than 1° C and only in a very

localized region this is far less than

normal temperature variation during the

day end quote now he didn&#39;t State how

long the exposure had to be but I assume

it would have to be a little while to

reach a temperature change of 1° so in

the end the Banning of the iPhone was a

decision made on principle there was a

safe limit set and apple exceeded it and

got banned as a result as it stands

apple is planning to release a software

update to rectify the

issue and with that we&#39;re at the end of

the episode I hope you learned something

new here and I&#39;m curious what are your

thoughts are you satisfied with a

consensus in the scientific Community
