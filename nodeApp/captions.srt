1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,480
okay this should be working

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,559.0000000000018
uh hopefully it is okay cool

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,480
so today we are going to talk about

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,400
oh well hello i&#39;m the ranches and today

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,199
we&#39;re going to be talking about

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,240
pairwise disjoint on how to be able to

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,519.0000000000036
solve a problem

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,839.9999999999964
that asks you to rewrite an expression

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,439
or not expression uh grammar as para

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,039
pairwise disjoint

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,960
so say we have this grammar

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,399
here this is just one the rules and

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,480.0000000000073
grammar this is our target rule that we

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,520
need to pay attention to

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,519.9999999999927
seven uh q

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120.00000000000728
i this is non-terminal by the way i just

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,239.00000000000728
didn&#39;t put the little things brackets

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,680
around it

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,680
uh 9 q

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,680
then 7q

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:01,280
q8 okay

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,280
yeah that&#39;ll work that&#39;ll work so

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
uh we could just zoom in and zoom out

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,920
just a tiny bit

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,520
so i could fit everything in

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,640
and then sorry let me come back and

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,39.99999999998545
do the pen and then

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,040
uh sorry about that

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,320
seven q seven nine seven

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,880
q seven

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
nine okay so this is what we&#39;ve got

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,640
right

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,119
so we have z is seven q

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
is seven then non-terminal q the nine

35
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,360
the non-terminal q

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,159
or seven the non-terminal q then eighth

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,720
and

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,360
or seven then non-terminal q then seven

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,399
the nine

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,520
right and the paralyzed joint test says

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,920
that for every

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,840
part of this for every or statement

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
so for every or statement which is this

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,798.9999999999854
the first value must be different

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,320.00000000001455
now as you can see this fails that test

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,600.0000000000146
because the first value

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,919.9999999999854
is not different actually the first

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,359.99999999998545
value is in fact the same on all of them

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,200
we have to find a way to change that and

50
00:02:09,360.00000000001455 --> 00:02:12,800
the best way to do it here at least in

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,519.9999999999709
our situation

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920.0000000000291
is to come down here and recognize that

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,239
this

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,679.9999999999709
repeats this pattern right here repeats

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,360
itself in each rule so then we could

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,440
create a rule for that right we could

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,800
say okay

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,560
uh we could say z is equal to

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:38,319.0000000000291
seven q right so we r rewrite z

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,599
as 7q then z prime

61
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,958.9999999999709
right and then we can define z prime

62
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,79.9999999999709
as 9 q

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,760
or 8

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,760.0000000000291
or seven nine

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,920
and now if you go back and look and

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,359.9999999999709
check to see whether the first

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,399.9999999999709
uh part the first each

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,40.000000000029104
section has the the first part of each

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,480.0000000000291
section

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,000
is the same value you see that

71
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,79.9999999999709
in this z rule the only value is seven

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,080
so it is it is unique right

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,760.0000000000291
here in each or part

74
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,760.0000000000291
we change we see that the first value

75
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,79.9999999999709
here is nine the first one is

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,280
eight and first one here is seven so

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
that&#39;s basically how you do it now if

78
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
you kind of if you want to

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,440
verify that you&#39;re what you&#39;re saying is

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,920
correct think about how you could

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,680
use these rules to create the original

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,958.9999999999709
rule right and the way you could do that

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,120
is that you could say okay well if i

84
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,319.0000000000291
want to create the original rule

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,640.0000000000291
i can substitute the z uh prime

86
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,79.9999999999709
for 9q right and i get this rule i

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,599
substitute that z prime

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,920.0000000000291
for eight q uh i substitute

89
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,760
z prime for eight i get this rule

90
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,839.9999999999709
substitute it for seven nine

91
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,760
i get this right here so this should all

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,439
kind of hopefully make a little more

93
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,599
sense to you guys

94
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,599
thanks for watching
