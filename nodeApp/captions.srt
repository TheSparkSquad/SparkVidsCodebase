hi welcome to another episode of Cold

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,480
Fusion France deleted the iPhone 12 from

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,840
sale due to high radiation levels this

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,439
raises some concerns if a phone is

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,279
released on the market shouldn&#39;t there

8
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,759.9999999999964
be a myriad of checks and balances to

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,080
make sure it&#39;s safe before it hits the

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,240.00000000000364
shelves have you ever wondered if your

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,598.9999999999964
smartphone could be harming your health

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,519.9999999999964
smartphones emit radiation right and

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,480.0000000000073
doesn&#39;t radiation cause cancer these

14
00:00:32,520.0000000000036 --> 00:00:36,680.0000000000073
types of questions come from common

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,319.9999999999927
confusion behind the types of radiation

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,120
and their effects on the human body in

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,360
this episode we&#39;ll look at how to think

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,760
about radiation how much radiation your

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,000
phone emits if it&#39;s dangerous and why

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,000
the iPhone 12 got

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
banned you are watching C Fusion

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,119
TV

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,158.99999999998545
first up what is radiation well

24
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,119
radiation is just a type of energy that

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,439
travels from one point to another either

26
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,240
as waves or

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,279.99999999998545
particles fun fact bananas produce

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,679.9999999999854
radiation so does air and even your body

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
in fact anything made of atoms produces

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,439
a little bit of radiation when some

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,360
unstable atoms within a given material

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,839.9999999999854
Decay this is called particle radiation

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,880
but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,960.0000000000146
here the kind of radiation we&#39;re talking

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,880
about in this episode is electrom

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,158.99999999998545
magnetic

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,920
radiation the sun emits this kind of

38
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,479.00000000001455
radiation your smartphone does and even

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,240.00000000001455
Wi-Fi so how much radiation does your

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,158.99999999998545
phone emit we can express the radiation

41
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,360
that lands on your body in watts per

42
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,280
kilogram this measures how energy is

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,320
absorbed by body tissue when exposed to

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,119
low levels of radiation the

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,320
internationally recognized safe limit

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,079
for mobile phones is 4 watts per kilog

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,000
so it goes that your phone would have

48
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,360
less than that amount but this is

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,479
meaningless without context is this

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,719
amount dangerous even if not it couldn&#39;t

51
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,560
be a good thing to have any radiation

52
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,440
close to our ears or near our brains

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,120
well to answer this let&#39;s first take a

54
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,959
look at the kind of radiation our phones

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,560
are

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,040
emitting phones emit radiation in the

57
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,160
radio frequency region of the

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,679.9999999999709
electromagnetic spectrum the higher the

59
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,799.9999999999709
frequency the higher the energy most

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,760.0000000000291
phones emit radio waves in the frequency

61
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,840
range of 1 to 3 GHz radios televisions

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,160
radar satellites micro wave ovens

63
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,800
computers and wireless networks use

64
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,920
frequencies in the same vicinity these

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,360
waves have less energy than visible

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,440
light this level of radiation is called

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,159.0000000000291
nonionizing that just means that these

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,319
waves don&#39;t have enough energy to strip

69
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,399.9999999999709
off electrons and cause DNA damage and

70
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,359.9999999999709
cancer but something happens when you

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,480.0000000000291
increase the frequency of these waves

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,159.0000000000291
beyond the frequency of visible light

73
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,159
Things become

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,000
dangerous evv light has energy just

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,640
above visual light and it damages our

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,040
skin via the sun levels at these

77
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,599
energies and above are called ionizing

78
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,798.9999999999709
radiation x-rays cosmic rays and gamma

79
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,238.9999999999709
rays from radioactive material fall

80
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:18,640.0000000000291
under this category it damages DNA ruins

81
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,920.0000000000291
genes and increases the risk of cancer

82
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,238.9999999999709
these are the waves to watch out for as

83
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,159
aside it&#39;s always cool to think that

84
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,159
x-rays Bluetooth and visible light are

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,599
the same thing just with different

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,920
wavelengths but some Keen eyed among you

87
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,560
would look at this diagram and say wait

88
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,439
a minute if microwaves can cook my food

89
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,120
and it has a similar wavelength as my

90
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,000
phone how is it that our brains aren&#39;t

91
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,799
getting cooked well amongst other

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,120
factors it&#39;s mainly about the power

93
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,319.0000000000291
level a microwave can blast out

94
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,079
electromagnetic waves with a figurative

95
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,119.9999999999709
force of 1,200 W of power a phone on the

96
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,480.0000000000291
other hand is in the range of M with

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,239
that being said all of us use mobile

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,599
phones so if there&#39;s any danger at all

99
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,920.0000000000291
we need to get to the bottom of this has

100
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,399.9999999999709
there been any increases in cancer that

101
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,760
coincides with the use of mobile phones

102
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
what if there&#39;s some mysterious

103
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,120
radiation phenomena that affects humans

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,239
a phenomena that exists in the exact

105
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,798.9999999999709
conditions of using a mobile phone is

106
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,639
there some scientific evidence to

107
00:04:16,798.9999999999709 --> 00:04:22,400
suggest that well surprisingly the

108
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,440
answer isn&#39;t a conclusive no let&#39;s take

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,799.9999999999418
a look we&#39;ll get to the surprising

110
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,000
research on smartphone radiation soon

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,919
but first a quick word from our sponsor

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,759
brilliant if some of the scientific

113
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,960
elements of this episode seem a bit

114
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,800
complicated there&#39;s now a fun and easy

115
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,039
way to learn more about them for

116
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,840.0000000000582
instance when I was doing videos on AI

117
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,240
brilliant&#39;s course on artificial neural

118
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,359.9999999999418

[Music]

130
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,400
continue so the bad news first a small

131
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,799.9999999999418
handful of Studies have shown that cell

132
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,440
phones and brain tumors are

133
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,880
statistically correlated for example a

134
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,639
Swedish study reported statistically

135
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,719.9999999999418
significant trends of increasing brain

136
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,199
cancer risk for people who begun using

137
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,000
mobile phones before the age of 20 the

138
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,680
risk was proportional to the number of

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,440
years and the amount of cell phones

140
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,600
usage but before you panic most other

141
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,039
studies indicate the opposite they state

142
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,560
that there&#39;s no link between mobile

143
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,880
phone use and rates of cancer another

144
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,960
study from Sweden showed no increase in

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,280
brain cancer among long-term cell phone

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,880
use between the ages of 20 and 69 an

147
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,679.9999999999418
international study of children

148
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,400
diagnosed with brain cancer between the

149
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,919
ages of 7 and 19 found no relationship

150
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,280
between their Mobile use and an

151
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,880
increased risk of brain cancer but for

152
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,758.9999999999418
more detail we should look into the

153
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,400
largest control study ever done on the

154
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,240
topic researchers from 13 countries

155
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,960
analyze questionnaires from participants

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,319
in Europe Israel Canada Australia New

157
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,919
Zealand and Japan the purpose was to

158
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,560
determine the risk of head and neck

159
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,039
tumors from mobile phone use the results

160
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,360
have been analyzed by the National

161
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,120
Cancer Institute in the US and they&#39;ve

162
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,479.0000000000582
laid out their findings as follows most

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,479
published analyses of the study show no

164
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:27,560
overall increases in brain or other

165
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,919
central nervous system cancers related

166
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,039
to higher amounts of mobile phone use

167
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,799.9999999999418
one analysis showed a statistically

168
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,719.9999999999418
significant although small increase in

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,840.0000000000582
the risk of brain tumors among study

170
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,759
participants who spent the most total

171
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,919
time on their phones although the

172
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,280.0000000000582
researchers state that due to a variety

173
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:47,479
of reasons this finding is

174
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,919
inconclusive another analysis of the

175
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,039
data of all 13 countries reported a

176
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,599
statistically significant association

177
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,840
between the distribution of interc

178
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,240
cranial tumors within the brain and the

179
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,119.99999999994179
self-reported location of the phone

180
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,800
however the authors of these studies

181
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,000
also say that these findings are

182
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,800
inconclusive and firm conclusions can&#39;t

183
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,960
be drawn another study of five northern

184
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
European countries showed an increase of

185
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,318.9999999999418
non-cancerous brain tumors in those who

186
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,639
have used a cell phone for 10 or more

187
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,199
years so what on Earth is going on here

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,479
why are the findings so inconsistent as

189
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,400.0000000000582
it turns out studying the physiological

190
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,840
effects of mobile radiation in humans is

191
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,000
hard there are so many ways that the

192
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,000
data could be muddied and skewed for

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,039
example

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,080
participants could mistakenly say that

195
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,039
they used their phone more or less than

196
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,800
they actually did during a given time

197
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,000
period it&#39;s just hard to accurately

198
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,199
recall aside from that this

199
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,120
participation bias people who are

200
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,800
diagnosed with brain tumors are more

201
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,159
likely than healthy people to enroll in

202
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,080
a research study some other factors that

203
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:52,120
can account for inconsistencies can

204
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
include the assumptions used to estimate

205
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,680
doses failure to consider temperature

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,840
effects and investigators not being

207
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,599
blinded to exposure status so even

208
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,638.9999999999418
though we don&#39;t have a definitive answer

209
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,360
on the risks of mobile phone use the

210
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,039
culmination of these studies point to

211
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,400.0000000000582
minimal effects if any and if it means

212
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:14,360
anything to you the FDA CDC and FCC all

213
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,120
say that there&#39;s no scientific evidence

214
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,520.0000000000582
that phones cause cancer and that

215
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,800
current regulations are safe quote based

216
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,719.9999999999418
on our ongoing evaluation of the issue

217
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,159
we have not found adverse health effects

218
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,919.0000000000582
in hum we believe the current safety

219
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:29,759
limits for cell phones are acceptable

220
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,880
for protecting the public health end

221
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,360
quote in any case it&#39;s probably a good

222
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,210.0000000000582
thing that we don&#39;t put our phones up to

223
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,389
our ears as much as we used

224
00:08:36,210.0000000000582 --> 00:08:39,389
[Music]

225
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,080
to so in all of this there&#39;s one

226
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,959
remaining question why did France ban

227
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,920.0000000001164
the iPhone 12 for emitting too much

228
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,640
radiation there must have been some

229
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,959
glitch that caused the phones to blast

230
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,439.9999999998836
out electromagnetic waves at microwave

231
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,279
oven power levels right well not quite

232
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,640.0000000001164
remember how the highest safe radiation

233
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,760
limit for mobile phones was 4 wats per

234
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,680
kg the iPhone 12 managed to score 5.74 W

235
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,360
per kgam as University of wenong

236
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,839
Professor Rodney crof says a radiation

237
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,800.0000000001164
reading of 5.74 wats per kgam is many

238
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,200
times below what would be required to

239
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,959
cause any harm it is important to note

240
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,920.0000000001164
that this will not have any impact on

241
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:27,399
health to put the exposure level into

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,439.9999999998836
context 5.7 watts per kog would only

243
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,360
cause a temperature rise in limbs of

244
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,680.0000000001164
less than 1° C and only in a very

245
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,480
localized region this is far less than

246
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,599.9999999998836
normal temperature variation during the

247
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,519
day end quote now he didn&#39;t State how

248
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,760
long the exposure had to be but I assume

249
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,480
it would have to be a little while to

250
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,760
reach a temperature change of 1° so in

251
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,640
the end the Banning of the iPhone was a

252
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,120
decision made on principle there was a

253
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,880
safe limit set and apple exceeded it and

254
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,560.0000000001164
got banned as a result as it stands

255
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,120
apple is planning to release a software

256
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,560
update to rectify the

257
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,120
issue and with that we&#39;re at the end of

258
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,199.99999999988358
